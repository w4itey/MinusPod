Verification pass for ad detection.

After the first pass detects and removes ads, this module re-transcribes
the processed audio and runs detection again with a "what doesn't belong"
prompt to catch missed ads. Returns dual timestamps: original-audio
coordinates for UI/DB and processed-audio coordinates for cutting.

# Changelog


All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.83] - 2026-03-17

### Changed
- **Codebase simplification pass**: Consolidated duplicate code, extracted shared utilities, and improved efficiency across backend Python source.
- **Extracted shared utilities**: `parse_iso_datetime()` in `utils/time.py`, `parse_transcript_segments()` and `get_transcript_text_for_range()` in `utils/text.py`, `get_with_retry()` in `utils/http.py`, `calculate_backoff()` in `utils/retry.py` -- replaces inline duplicates across 10+ files.
- **Provider constants moved to config.py**: `PROVIDER_ANTHROPIC`, `PROVIDER_OPENROUTER`, `PROVIDER_OLLAMA`, `PROVIDERS_NON_ANTHROPIC` now defined in `config.py` instead of `llm_client.py`.
- **Webhook service refactored**: Replaced `urllib.request`/`_dispatch_webhook()` with `post_with_retry()`, replaced inline datetime formatting with `utc_now_iso()`, added `WebhookPayload` dataclass. Webhook retry now only retries transient errors (429/5xx) instead of all HTTP errors.
- **Stats query consolidated**: Replaced 7 separate `SELECT COUNT/AVG/SUM` queries in `get_processing_history_stats()` with a single `CASE WHEN` conditional aggregation query.
- **Fingerprint N+1 query fixed**: `_load_fingerprints_from_db()` now uses a single JOIN query instead of per-row `get_ad_pattern_by_id()` calls.
- **LLM client improvements**: Extracted `_log_messages()` to base class, replaced `httpx` with `requests` in Ollama fallback, added 5-minute TTL model list cache.
- **Ad detector cleanup**: Removed `_is_retryable_error()` wrapper (calls `is_retryable_error()` directly), removed `RETRY_CONFIG` dict (uses shared `calculate_backoff()`), removed `DEFAULT_MODEL` re-export (consumers import `DEFAULT_AD_DETECTION_MODEL` from config), renamed `_learn_from_detections` to `learn_from_detections`.
- **Transcriber cleanup**: Removed `format_timestamp()` wrapper (uses `format_vtt_timestamp()` directly), optimized `_should_reload()` to return model name for reuse in `get_instance()`.
- **Processing pipeline**: Replaced inline transcript parsing with `parse_transcript_segments()`, eliminated duplicate `get_audio_duration()` call.
- **Pricing fetcher**: Added retry via `get_with_retry()` to `fetch_openrouter_pricing()` and `fetch_pricepertoken_pricing()`, replaced inline ISO datetime parsing with `parse_iso_datetime()`.

### Removed
- Legacy OpenRouter Whisper migration code in `transcriber.py` (`_LEGACY_BACKEND_OPENROUTER`, migration fallback blocks) -- migration was completed in v1.0.68.
- `_dispatch_webhook()` in webhook_service.py (replaced by `post_with_retry()` from utils).
- `_segments_to_text()` in roll_detector.py (replaced by `get_transcript_text_for_range()` from utils).
- `get_transcript_text_for_range()` in ad_detector.py (moved to utils/text.py).
- `httpx` dependency usage in llm_client.py (replaced with `requests`).
- Legacy `openai` and `wrapper` provider aliases from `PROVIDERS_NON_ANTHROPIC` -- standardized on `openai-compatible` and `ollama` only.

## [1.0.82] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- **Duplicate pricing fetches across gunicorn workers**: Each worker had its own in-memory `_last_fetch` counter, causing independent pricing fetches on every container start. Added DB-level coordination via `MAX(updated_at)` from `model_pricing` table -- if another worker recently wrote pricing within TTL, the second worker syncs its in-memory timer and skips the HTTP fetch.
- **Pre-roll detection gap in Full reprocess mode**: Full mode (`skip_patterns=True`) bypasses Stages 1 & 2, leaving `detect_preroll()` as the sole safety net for short pre-roll ads. Lowered the ad pattern match threshold from 2 to 1 when `skip_patterns=True` so DAI pre-rolls with a single obvious ad indicator are caught.
- **Prefix match pricing lookup matched wrong models**: `_calculate_token_cost` prefix fallback could match a shorter stored key to a longer distinct model (e.g., `gpt4o` incorrectly matching `gpt4omini`). Added 80% length coverage requirement so stored keys must cover most of the lookup key.
- **Per-window LLM retry retried non-retryable errors**: `_call_llm_for_window` per-window retry loop retried unconditionally, including auth and forbidden errors. Now checks `is_retryable_error()` before entering per-window retries.
- **Raw exception leaked in pricing refresh 502 response**: `POST /system/model-pricing/refresh` returned `str(e)` in the error response, potentially exposing internal paths. Now returns a generic message and logs details server-side.
- **OpenAPI spec gaps**: Added missing `?source=` on `GET /system/model-pricing`, `?page=` on `GET /history`, and `400` response on `GET /settings/models`.
- **Normalization variant suffix case sensitivity**: `normalize_model_key` only stripped lowercase OpenRouter suffixes (`:free`); now handles mixed case (`:Free`, `:Extended`).
- **Pricing upsert dual-constraint tension**: `upsert_fetched_pricing` could hit PK/UNIQUE conflict if scraped data contained duplicate display names. Added pre-loop deduplication by `match_key`.
- **Fingerprint sliding window list allocation**: `_find_matches_fast` created a new list slice per sliding step (~1200x per episode). Refactored `_calculate_similarity` to accept start/end indices, avoiding the copy.
- **LLM client race on `_cached_client`**: Added `_client_lock` to synchronize `get_llm_client()` across threads.
- **Pricing refresh blocks settings save**: `force_refresh_pricing()` in the provider-change settings handler now runs in a background thread instead of blocking the HTTP response.

## [1.0.81] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- **Stale models on provider switch**: Model dropdown now refetches immediately when switching LLM provider (e.g. Anthropic to OpenRouter). The `GET /settings/models` endpoint accepts an optional `?provider=` query param so the frontend can preview models for a provider before saving settings. React Query key includes the selected provider for automatic cache separation.
- **Missing prices on OpenRouter free models**: `fetch_openrouter_pricing()` no longer skips models where both input and output costs are $0. Free models (`:free` suffix) are now stored with $0 pricing so the UI displays pricing instead of showing nothing.

### Removed
- **Anthropic model alias filtering and resolution**: The `_filter_anthropic_aliases()` filter in `list_models()` and the `resolve_anthropic_alias()` runtime resolution in `get_model()`, `get_verification_model()`, and `get_chapters_model()` were added in v1.0.78-1.0.79 to work around intermittent 400 errors that turned out to be caused by an API key issue, not by Anthropic rejecting alias model IDs. Model IDs from the API and database are now used as-is without filtering or resolution (reverts to v1.0.74 behavior).

## [1.0.80] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- **Fingerprint scan 1000x slower than expected**: Sliding window fingerprint search spawned 2 subprocesses (ffmpeg + fpcalc) per 2-second step, resulting in ~2378 subprocess calls for a 40-minute episode. Refactored `find_matches()` to pre-compute one full-file fingerprint via a single fpcalc call, then compare by slicing the raw int array in pure Python. Falls back to per-window scanning if full-file fingerprint fails.
- **History page pagination broken**: Frontend sends `page` param but backend only read `offset`, so every page returned the same results. Backend now accepts `page`, converts to offset, and includes `page` in the response. The `offset` param still works for backwards compatibility.
- **API errors abort entire episode processing**: A single LLM window failure (400/500) killed ad detection for the whole episode. Added per-window retry (2 extra attempts with 2s/5s backoff) and skip-on-failure logic so partial results are returned. Only aborts if ALL windows fail. Applied to both detection and verification passes.

## [1.0.79] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- **Alias filter incorrectly removes new models (Sonnet 4.6, Opus 4.6)**: `_filter_anthropic_aliases()` used family-based grouping that treated `claude-sonnet-4-6` and `claude-opus-4-6` as aliases for their 4.5 counterparts. Replaced `_claude_family()` with `_strip_date_suffix()` so a non-dated model is only filtered when a dated model with the exact same version prefix exists. Restored 4.6 pricing entries in `DEFAULT_MODEL_PRICING`.

## [1.0.78] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- **Use canonical model IDs, filter aliases dynamically**: Anthropic's `models.list()` returns both alias IDs (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4-6`) and dated inference IDs (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`). Aliases are not reliably accepted by the messages API, causing intermittent 400 errors. `AnthropicClient.list_models()` now dynamically filters out aliases when a dated counterpart exists, so the UI dropdown only shows dated IDs. A safety net resolves any alias stored in DB to its dated counterpart at runtime in `get_model()`, `get_verification_model()`, and `get_chapters_model()`.
- **Token tracking uses requested model ID**: Both `AnthropicClient` and `OpenAICompatibleClient` now record the requested model ID in `LLMResponse.model` instead of `response.model` from the provider, preventing DB fragmentation across model name variants.
- **Remove alias-only pricing entries**: Removed `claude-opus-4-6` and `claude-sonnet-4-6` from `DEFAULT_MODEL_PRICING` to prevent silent conflicts with their dated counterparts during `seed_default_pricing()`.

## [1.0.77] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- **Stale models on provider change**: Switching LLM provider in Settings now clears model dropdown selections immediately, preventing stale models from the previous provider from persisting until save.
- **OpenRouter variant suffix normalization**: `normalize_model_key` now strips OpenRouter variant suffixes (`:free`, `:extended`, `:beta`, `:nitro`) before normalization, so `z-ai/glm-4.5-air:free` correctly matches pricing for `glm-4.5-air`.

## [1.0.76] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- **Migration failure on existing DB**: Seed INSERT into `model_pricing` no longer references `match_key`, `raw_model_id`, or `source` columns that only exist after the ALTER TABLE migration runs. Existing DBs upgrading from pre-1.0.75 schemas will now migrate cleanly.
- **Stale pricing after provider change**: Switching LLM provider now calls `force_refresh_pricing()` to immediately fetch pricing for the new provider, instead of just resetting the TTL and waiting up to 15 minutes for the background loop.
- **Noisy duplicate column log**: Downgraded the "duplicate column name" log in `_add_column_if_missing` from ERROR to WARNING, since this is expected when multiple gunicorn workers race to run the same ALTER TABLE migration.

## [1.0.75] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Multi-provider LLM pricing**: Cost tracking now works for any LLM provider, not just Anthropic. Pricing is fetched live from OpenRouter's API (for OpenRouter users) or scraped from pricepertoken.com (for Anthropic, OpenAI, Groq, Mistral, DeepSeek, xAI, Together, Fireworks, Perplexity, and Google). Pricing refreshes automatically every 24 hours and on provider change. Local/Ollama providers report $0.
- **Model name normalization**: A `normalize_model_key()` function maps model names across different naming conventions (API IDs, display names, provider-prefixed IDs) to a single lookup key, so pricing matches regardless of source format.
- **Manual pricing refresh endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/system/model-pricing/refresh` forces an immediate pricing data refresh from the active provider's pricing source.
- **Pricing source tracking**: Each model pricing entry now records its source (`openrouter_api`, `pricepertoken`, `default`, `legacy`) and the raw model ID from the pricing source.
- **New dependency**: `beautifulsoup4` for HTML table parsing from pricepertoken.com.

### Changed
- **Schema migration**: `model_pricing` table gains `match_key`, `raw_model_id`, and `source` columns with a UNIQUE index on `match_key`. `token_usage` table gains `match_key` column. Existing rows are backfilled automatically. No data loss.
- **Cost calculation**: `_calculate_token_cost()` now uses normalized `match_key` lookups instead of raw `model_id` matching.
- **Token usage joins**: `get_token_usage_summary()` joins on `match_key` instead of `model_id` for correct pricing display across providers.
- **Model list enrichment**: `_enrich_models_with_pricing()` uses `match_key` lookups and no longer calls `refresh_model_pricing()` directly (pricing comes from background fetch).
- **Default pricing demoted to fallback**: `DEFAULT_MODEL_PRICING` is only used when live fetch fails AND the pricing table is empty (air-gapped/offline installs).

## [1.0.74] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Theme system**: User-selectable color themes on the Settings page (Catppuccin Mocha/Macchiato/Frappe, Dracula with 6 accent variants, Nord, Gruvbox, Solarized, Tokyo Night, GitHub Dark, UniFi, Blue Slate). The existing dark/light toggle switches between the light and dark halves of the active theme. Themes persist in localStorage. Frontend-only, no backend changes.

## [1.0.73] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- **FFMPEG timeout on long episodes (Issue #88)**: FFMPEG ad-removal timeout now scales with episode duration (5 min base + 5 sec per minute of audio) instead of a hardcoded 300s. A 107-minute episode now gets ~14 minutes instead of 5. Audio preprocessing timeout also scales by file size. Fixes consistent failures on emulated platforms (e.g. amd64 Docker on ARM Macs via Orbstack).

### Changed
- **Dockerfile**: Removed hardcoded `--platform=linux/amd64` from both build stages. Platform should be passed via `docker build --platform` or `docker-compose` config instead of baked into the Dockerfile.

## [1.0.72] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- **Whisper model reload per chunk causing 2-3x transcription slowdown**: `transcribe_chunked()` was unloading and reloading the Whisper model after every chunk (14-18s reload each time, including HuggingFace API round-trip). Model is now kept loaded across chunks and unloaded once after all chunks complete. GPU cache clearing between chunks is preserved.

## [1.0.71] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- **Stuck episode processing (fingerprint loop)**: Audio fingerprint scanning now has a 10-minute timeout (was unbounded). A 176-minute episode could spawn ~5,280 subprocess iterations with no escape. Scanning now logs progress every 60 seconds, checks for cancellation each iteration, and returns partial results on timeout.
- **Cancel not respected during ad detection**: Cancel events are now checked between all three ad detection stages (fingerprint, text pattern, Claude API) and within the fingerprint scan loop itself. Previously, cancellation was only checked between top-level pipeline stages.
- **Processing queue force-clear safety net**: Jobs stuck for over 2 hours are now force-cleared from the processing queue, even when the lock is held by the same process. This prevents a hung processing thread from blocking all future episode processing indefinitely.

## [1.0.70] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- **Mobile UI: History page filters cut off**: Status and podcast filter dropdowns now stack vertically on mobile instead of being squeezed side-by-side
- **Mobile UI: Feed detail card overflow**: Podcast artwork and content now stack vertically on mobile; network badges and Edit button wrap instead of overflowing
- **Auto-Process dropdown labels**: Renamed verbose options from "Use Global Setting / Always Enable / Always Disable" to cleaner "Global Default / Enabled / Disabled" on both FeedDetail and AddFeed pages
- **Missing episode descriptions (Relay FM and similar feeds)**: RSS parser now falls back to `itunes:summary`, `itunes:subtitle`, and `content:encoded` when `<description>` is empty. DB upsert also backfills empty descriptions and titles on next feed refresh.

## [1.0.69] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- **Whisper language misdetection**: Local Whisper backend used `language=None` (auto-detect) which misidentified English podcasts as Spanish (93% confidence on music intros), corrupting transcriptions and generating false ad detections. Now uses `language='en'` matching the API backend. Non-English DAI ads are still caught by text-based heuristics.
- **Ad detection crash on empty LLM response**: When the LLM returns `None` content (empty response, refusal, or content filtering), `ad_detector.py` crashed with `object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`. Both Anthropic and OpenAI-compatible `messages_create` now coerce `None` content to empty string.

## [1.0.68] - 2026-03-15

### Removed
- **OpenRouter as Whisper backend**: OpenRouter does not support the `/v1/audio/transcriptions` endpoint -- all transcription attempts returned 500 errors. The `openrouter-api` whisper backend has been removed from config, settings API, frontend UI, and documentation. Users who had this backend configured will automatically fall back to local Whisper with a warning log. For cloud transcription without a GPU, use `WHISPER_BACKEND=openai-api` with Groq or another OpenAI-compatible provider. OpenRouter remains fully supported as an LLM provider.

## [1.0.67] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- **OpenRouter Whisper 413 errors**: Reduced chunk duration from 10 min (600s) to 2.5 min (150s) for OpenRouter backend to stay under payload size limit. OpenAI API backend unchanged at 600s.
- **`_verify_endpoint` logged misleading URL**: Removed unused `base_url` parameter; now reads the actual URL from the client after construction.
- **OpenRouter API key format validation**: Settings API now rejects keys that do not start with `sk-or-`.
- **Frontend: OpenRouter key sent after provider switch**: Clearing `openrouterApiKey` state when switching away from OpenRouter prevents stale key from being saved.

### Added
- Tests for OpenRouter whisper settings auto-population and chunk duration calculation.

## [1.0.66] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- **OpenRouter model filtering**: `model_matches_provider` now returns True for OpenRouter (routes to any model), fixing false rejections of claude models via OpenRouter.
- **LLM provider validation**: `llmProvider` is now validated against known providers before DB storage, preventing invalid values from persisting.
- **OpenRouter startup verification**: `verify_llm_connection` now actually calls `verify_connection()` for OpenRouter instead of only checking key presence.
- **Nested ternary in LLMProviderSection**: Extracted `renderApiKeyStatus()` helper for readability.
- **Redundant expose directive**: Removed `expose: "8000"` from `docker-compose.openrouter.yml` (redundant with `ports`).

### Added
- **OpenRouter model/verify tests**: 8 new tests covering `model_matches_provider` for OpenRouter and `verify_llm_connection` OpenRouter paths.

## [1.0.65] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- **Whisper API 413 errors**: Convert preprocessed WAV to FLAC (lossless, ~4-5x smaller) before uploading to Whisper API, preventing HTTP 413 (Request Entity Too Large) errors from APIs with tight upload limits (e.g. OpenRouter).

## [1.0.64] - 2026-03-15

### Improved
- **WHISPER_BACKENDS constant**: Frontend whisper backend comparisons now use a shared constant object, matching the existing `LLM_PROVIDERS` pattern.
- **Model sort deduplication**: Alphabetical sort moved into `_enrich_models_with_pricing` to avoid duplicate logic across endpoints.
- **OpenRouter whisper save fix**: Frontend no longer sends empty `whisperApiBaseUrl` for OpenRouter backend, which was overriding the backend's `reset_setting` call.
- **docker-compose.openrouter.yml cleanup**: Removed deprecated `version` key and `RETENTION_PERIOD` env var.

### Added
- **OpenRouter unit tests**: 11 tests covering `get_effective_openrouter_api_key`, `get_llm_client`, `get_api_key`, timeout, and retry logic for the openrouter provider.

## [1.0.63] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **OpenRouter LLM provider**: Use 200+ models via one API key. Set `LLM_PROVIDER=openrouter` and `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, or switch from the Settings UI at runtime.
- **OpenRouter Whisper backend**: `WHISPER_BACKEND=openrouter-api` routes transcription through OpenRouter -- no NVIDIA GPU needed.
- **Frontend OpenRouter UI**: Provider dropdown, inline API key input, and status badges in Settings.
- **docker-compose.openrouter.yml**: Ready-to-use compose file for GPU-free OpenRouter setup.
- **.env.example**: Template covering all LLM and Whisper provider options.
- **curl in Docker image**: For container health checks.
- **README Disclaimer section**: Moved disclaimer to a dedicated section at the bottom with ToC link; converted scattered warnings to footnotes.
- **Alphabetical model sorting**: LLM model dropdowns now sort alphabetically by name.

## [1.0.62] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- **RSS feed cache permanently stale on HTTP 304**: When upstream RSS returned 304 Not Modified, `last_checked_at` was not updated, causing every subsequent request to trigger a redundant refresh. Feeds polled frequently (e.g. PocketCasts every minute) would show thousands of minutes stale and make unnecessary upstream checks.
- **OpenAI gpt-5-mini failing with max_tokens** (fixes #81): Newer OpenAI models require `max_completion_tokens` instead of `max_tokens`. The OpenAI-compatible client now tries `max_completion_tokens` first and falls back to `max_tokens` for older APIs, caching the result per model.

## [1.0.61] - 2026-03-15

### Security
- **Remove system Python cryptography/PyJWT**: Docker Scout flagged CVEs in Ubuntu 24.04 system packages (`python3-cryptography 41.0.7`, `python3-jwt 2.7.0`) at `/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/`. Our venv already has fixed versions; removed system copies that Scout was scanning. Fixes 6 CVEs.
- **Upgrade setuptools, remove vendored jaraco/wheel**: setuptools bundles old copies of `jaraco.context` and `wheel` in its `_vendor/` directory. Upgraded setuptools and removed vendored copies. Fixes 2 CVEs.
- **torch 2.6.0 CVEs (accepted risk)**: CVE-2025-3730 (Medium, fix: 2.8.0) and CVE-2025-2953 (Low, fix: 2.7.1-rc1) are DoS-only in functions (`ctc_loss`, `mkldnn_max_pool2d`) not used by our pipeline. No stable fix available yet.

## [1.0.60] - 2026-03-15

### Security
- **PyTorch 2.5.0 -> 2.6.0**: Fixes CVE-2025-32434 (CRITICAL, CVSS 9.3) -- RCE via `torch.load` weights_only bypass. CUDA variant moved from cu121 to cu124.
- **cryptography >= 46.0.5**: Fixes CVE-2026-26007 (HIGH, CVSS 8.2), CVE-2023-50782 (HIGH, CVSS 8.7), CVE-2024-26130 (HIGH, CVSS 7.5), CVE-2024-0727 (MEDIUM), GHSA-h4gh-qq45-vh27
- **flask-cors 4.0.2 -> >= 6.0.0**: Fixes CVE-2024-6844, CVE-2024-6866, CVE-2024-6839 (CORS bypass)
- **flask 3.0.3 -> >= 3.1.3**: Fixes CVE-2026-27205 (LOW, CVSS 2.3)

### Fixed
- **Gunicorn worker crash on startup (code 134/SIGABRT)**: CTranslate2 4.4.0 requires cuDNN 8 (`libcudnn_ops_infer.so.8`) but PyTorch 2.5.0+ only ships cuDNN 9. Added cuDNN 8 runtime libraries to `/opt/cudnn8/lib` via `nvidia-cudnn-cu12==8.9.7.29` and updated `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. This was causing one worker to abort on every container restart.

## [1.0.59] - 2026-03-14

### Security
- **PyTorch 2.3.0 -> 2.5.0**: Fixes CVE-2024-48063 (CRITICAL, CVSS 9.8) -- RCE via `torch.distributed.rpc.RemoteModule` deserialization
- **flask-cors 4.0.0 -> 4.0.2**: Fixes CVE-2024-6221 (HIGH, CVSS 8.7) and 3 additional CORS bypass CVEs
- **requests >= 2.32.4**: Fixes CVE-2024-47081 (MEDIUM, CVSS 5.3)
- **Pin cryptography >= 42.0.4**: Fixes 3 HIGH CVEs in transitive dependency
- **Pin pyjwt >= 2.12.0**: Fixes CVE-2026-32597 (HIGH, CVSS 7.5)
- **Pin jaraco.context >= 6.1.0**: Fixes CVE-2026-23949 (HIGH, CVSS 8.6)
- **Pin wheel >= 0.46.2**: Fixes CVE-2026-24049 (HIGH, CVSS 7.1)
- **apt-get upgrade in Dockerfile**: Picks up security patches for gnupg2 (HIGH), sqlite3 (MEDIUM), gnutls28 (MEDIUM)

## [1.0.58] - 2026-03-14

### Changed
- **Docker base image upgrade**: Upgraded from `nvidia/cuda:12.1.1-runtime-ubuntu22.04` to `nvidia/cuda:12.6.3-runtime-ubuntu24.04` to resolve Docker Scout CVEs from outdated Ubuntu 22.04 system packages. Python 3.11 now installed from deadsnakes PPA (Ubuntu 24.04 defaults to 3.12). Pip bootstrapped via `ensurepip` instead of `python3-pip` package. PyTorch continues to bundle its own CUDA/cuDNN via pip, so the base image CUDA version change has no runtime impact.

## [1.0.57] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed
- **Verification pass ignoring whisper backend**: Second pass (verification) was hardcoded to use local GPU whisper via `WhisperModelSingleton`, bypassing `WHISPER_BACKEND` config. Now routes through `Transcriber.transcribe()` when backend is `openai-api`, matching first pass behavior. (GitHub #7)
- **SSE queue unbounded growth**: `queue.Queue()` had no maxsize, so `put_nowait` could never raise `queue.Full` -- the "drop if full" logic was dead code. Status updates accumulated unboundedly during long processing runs, causing large SSE payloads. Added `maxsize=50` so stale updates are dropped.
- **Fingerprint comparison TypeError**: `compare_fingerprints()` passed `str` to `chromaprint.decode_fingerprint()` which expects `bytes` (ctypes `c_char` pointer). Now encodes to bytes before calling the C library.
- **Episode ID churn on every refresh**: Acast/Megaphone feeds change RSS GUIDs between fetches, causing repeated "Episode ID changed" warnings. Now updates the stored `episode_id` for discovered episodes to match the new GUID, and downgrades the log from WARNING to DEBUG.
- **Duplicate worker processing (broken leader election)**: `open(lock_path, 'w')` truncated the lock file, creating a race where both Gunicorn workers could acquire `flock()`. Changed to `open(lock_path, 'a')` (append mode) which doesn't truncate, so `flock(LOCK_EX|LOCK_NB)` works correctly.

## [1.0.56] - 2026-03-13

### Changed
- **Settings page reorganization**: Grouped related sections under category headings (AI & Processing, Output, Data & Security) and reordered for logical flow
- Processing Queue section auto-expands when episodes are actively processing
- AI Models section now defaults to open on first visit
- Moved "Reset All Episodes" from System Status into Data Management section

## [1.0.55] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- **Remote whisper empty segments**: Removed `--convert` flag from `docker-compose.whisper.yml` -- whisper.cpp fails silently when it cannot write temp files to the CWD in Docker, returning 200 with 0 segments. MinusPod already sends preprocessed 16kHz mono WAV so conversion is unnecessary.
- Added `working_dir: /tmp` to whisper compose service as a safety net for any temp file writes
- Added `--no-flash-attn` to whisper compose so DTW word-level timestamps work (flash attention silently disables DTW)
- Log warning when whisper API returns 200 with 0 usable segments, including raw response body for diagnosis

### Changed
- README: Updated Remote Whisper section to document the `--convert` issue and note that MinusPod preprocesses audio to WAV

## [1.0.54] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **Remote whisper transcription backend**: OpenAI-compatible HTTP API backend for whisper transcription, enabling use of whisper.cpp (Apple Silicon), Groq, or OpenAI as the inference engine
  - New `whisper_backend` setting: switch between `local` (faster-whisper, default) and `openai-api`
  - Configurable API base URL, API key (write-only), and model name via Settings UI and env vars
  - `WHISPER_BACKEND`, `WHISPER_API_BASE_URL`, `WHISPER_API_KEY`, `WHISPER_API_MODEL` environment variables
  - Fixed 10-minute chunk duration for API backend (fits under 25MB API upload limit)
  - Retry with exponential backoff on 429/5xx responses
  - Settings UI: backend selector with conditional fields matching LLM Provider section pattern
- Unit tests for API transcription response parsing, backend dispatch, and chunk duration
- Integration tests for whisper backend settings round-trip via API

### Changed
- Transcription Settings section now shows backend selector; local model picker only visible when backend is "local"

## [1.0.53] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **Podcast name in webhook payloads**: Webhook payloads now include a `podcast` section with `name` and `slug` fields, available as `podcast.name` and `podcast.slug` template variables
- Test webhook and template preview also include podcast name data

## [1.0.52] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **OPML export**: `GET /api/v1/feeds/export-opml` exports all feed subscriptions as OPML 2.0 file
- **Database backup**: `GET /api/v1/system/backup` downloads a consistent SQLite backup (rate limited 6/hour)
- **Outbound webhooks**: Configurable HTTP POST webhooks fired on `episode.processed` and `episode.failed` events
  - Custom Jinja2 payload templates for integration with any HTTP endpoint (Pushover, ntfy, n8n, etc.)
  - Optional HMAC-SHA256 request signing via `X-MinusPod-Signature` header
  - Template validation and live preview via API and Settings UI
  - Fire-and-forget delivery with 2 retry attempts per webhook
- **Webhook management UI**: Full CRUD in Settings > Webhooks section with template editor and test firing
- **Data Management section**: New Settings section with OPML export and database backup download buttons
- **Webhook examples in README**: Pushover and ntfy integration walkthroughs with template examples

### Changed
- **Webhook formatted payload fields**: Added human-readable `processing_time` (M:SS), `llm_cost_display` ($X.XX), and `time_saved` (M:SS) alongside raw numeric values in webhook payloads
- **Webhook README examples**: Pushover and ntfy examples now use pre-formatted fields instead of inline Jinja2 formatting
- **Storage formatting**: Values now auto-format to GB when >= 1024 MB (SystemStatus, EpisodeDetail, FeedDetail, cleanup results)
- **System Status section**: Always expanded on Settings page load (localStorage reset on mount)
- **`formatStorage` utility**: New shared formatter in `settingsUtils.ts` for consistent MB/GB display

### Fixed
- **Storage display consistency**: All storage displays now use the same `formatStorage` formatter instead of inline `.toFixed(1) MB`

## [1.0.51] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **Original transcript storage**: First-pass transcript is saved as `original_transcript_text` in episode_details (write-once, preserved across reprocessing) so users can see what was removed
- **Original Transcript panel**: Episode Detail page shows collapsible "Original Transcript" section with raw pre-cut transcript
- **Ad Editor Workflow section in README**: Clarifies that ad preview audio plays processed output intentionally (review-and-reprocess model)

### Changed
- **Transcript panel now collapsible**: Existing transcript display uses `CollapsibleSection` component for consistency with the rest of the app
- **API response includes original transcript**: `originalTranscriptAvailable` boolean in episode detail endpoint; full text lazy-loaded via `/original-transcript` endpoint
- **CollapsibleSection localStorage key**: Added optional `storageKey` prop; episode detail panels use explicit keys instead of `settings-section-*` prefix
- **Shared `_get_episode_db_id` helper**: Lightweight ID lookup extracted for `save_episode_details`, `save_original_transcript`, `save_episode_audio_analysis`, `clear_episode_details`
- **Original transcript routed through Storage layer**: `storage.save_original_transcript()` for consistency with other transcript operations

### Fixed
- **`_get_episode_db_id` return type**: Annotation now `-> Optional[int]` matching actual behavior (returns `None` when not found)
- **`get_original_transcript` two-query overhead**: Collapsed `_get_episode_db_id` + SELECT into a single JOIN query
- **Original transcript spinner on error**: Destructure `isError` from query; show error message instead of infinite `LoadingSpinner`
- **Original transcript section empty on revisit**: Initialize `originalTranscriptRequested` from localStorage so query fires when section was previously opened
- **Original transcript query fires without availability check**: Added `originalTranscriptAvailable` guard to query `enabled` condition to prevent spurious API calls
- **README ToC**: Trimmed deeply nested sub-items to top-level sections with select sub-items

### Note
- Episodes processed before v1.0.51 will not have an original transcript. To populate it, reprocess the episode -- the next transcription will be captured as the original.

## [1.0.50] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **CDN-not-ready episodes permanently failing too fast**: JIT route retries bypassed queue backoff, burning all 3 retries in ~34 seconds. Added exponential cooldown (60s/120s/240s) between JIT retries so CDN propagation has time to complete. Returns 503 with Retry-After header during cooldown.

## [1.0.49] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **AudioMetadata unbounded cache**: Added `_MAX_CACHE_SIZE = 500` with LRU eviction to prevent memory leak on long-running servers
- **Unused axios dependency**: Removed `axios` from frontend dependencies (codebase uses `fetch` via `apiRequest()`)
- **Dockerfile missing platform**: Added `--platform=linux/amd64` to both FROM statements per project guidelines

### Improved
- **Centralized LLM model constants**: Moved `DEFAULT_AD_DETECTION_MODEL` and `DEFAULT_CHAPTERS_MODEL` to `config.py`; `ad_detector.py` and `chapters_generator.py` import from config
- **Standardized import aliases**: Removed inconsistent `_get_audio_duration` / `_utils_get_audio_duration` aliases in `audio_processor.py`, `transcriber.py`, `audio_fingerprinter.py`; all now use direct `from utils.audio import get_audio_duration`
- **Frontend query string builder**: Extracted `buildQueryString()` utility in `api/client.ts`; refactored `feeds.ts`, `history.ts`, `search.ts`, `patterns.ts` to use it
- **Volume threshold in config**: Moved `VolumeAnalyzer` default `anomaly_threshold_db` (3.0) to `config.py` as `VOLUME_ANOMALY_THRESHOLD_DB`

### Post-Review Fixes
- **CRITICAL: `get_podcast_id` missing method**: `cleanup_duplicate_episodes()` in `database/maintenance.py` called nonexistent `get_podcast_id()`; replaced with `get_podcast_by_slug()` + id extraction
- **Duplicate `MAX_EPISODE_RETRIES` constant**: Removed independent definitions from `main_app/routes.py`, `processing.py`, and `background.py`; all three now import from `config.py`
- **Split `_permanently_failed_warned` set**: Created `main_app/shared_state.py` with shared set; `routes.py` and `processing.py` both import from it, restoring cross-module log dedup
- **Duplicate json import in routes.py**: Removed `import json as _json` alias, replaced `_json.xxx` calls with `json.xxx`
- **Unused inter-mixin import in stats.py**: Removed dead `from database.settings import DEFAULT_MODEL_PRICING` import
- **Inline imports in main_app/__init__.py**: Moved `import threading`, `import json`, `import secrets` to top-level; kept `from version import __version__` deferred (path constraint)
- **Inline `import json as _json` in processing.py**: Moved `json` import to top-level, removed inline alias in `_run_audio_analysis()`

### Smoke Test Fixes
- **Settings reset missing keys**: `POST /settings/ad-detection/reset` did not reset `min_cut_confidence` or `auto_process_enabled`; added both to `reset_ad_detection_settings()` in `api/settings.py` and to the `defaults` dict in `database/settings.py`
- **Frontend README stale dependency**: Updated `frontend/README.md` to reference Fetch API instead of removed Axios dependency

### Refactored
- **database.py -> database/ package**: Split 4170-line monolith into 12-file package with mixin classes (SchemaMixin, PodcastMixin, EpisodeMixin, SettingsMixin, PatternMixin, SponsorMixin, StatsMixin, MaintenanceMixin, FingerprintMixin, QueueMixin, SearchMixin). All downstream imports preserved.
- **api.py -> api/ package**: Split 3616-line monolith into 11-file package with Flask Blueprint sub-modules (feeds, episodes, history, settings, system, patterns, sponsors, status, auth, search). All routes preserved.
- **main.py -> main_app/ package**: Split 2043-line monolith into 6-file package (cache, feeds, background, processing, routes). Updated entrypoint.sh for `main_app:app`.
- **AdEditor.tsx -> components**: Split 1022-line component into orchestrator + 8 sub-components in `ad-editor/` directory. Deduplicated BoundaryControls (3x -> 1x with variant prop) and ActionButtons (3x -> 1x with variant prop).
- **Settings.tsx -> sections**: Split 963-line page into orchestrator + 11 section components + `settingsUtils.ts` in `settings/` directory. SecuritySection owns its own password state.

## [1.0.48] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **Patterns page table overflow**: Switched to `table-fixed` layout with proportional `<colgroup>` widths so all 8 columns fit within the viewport without horizontal scrolling
- **Long podcast names in Scope column**: Added truncation to podcast scope badges to prevent layout blowout
- **Sponsor column overflow**: Added `overflow-hidden` and `truncate` to sponsor name and text template cells
- **Column padding**: Tightened padding on narrow columns (ID, Confirmed, False Pos., Status) from `px-4` to `px-2`

## [1.0.47] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **observed_duration truthiness bug**: `pattern_service.record_pattern_match()` now uses `is not None` check so duration=0.0 is not silently dropped
- **Claude feedback double-update**: Duration feedback loop now tracks updated pattern IDs in a set, preventing inflation of `duration_samples` when multiple Claude ads overlap the same pattern region
- **Claude feedback routed through pattern_service**: `ad_detector` now calls `pattern_service.update_duration()` instead of bypassing the service layer with a direct `db.update_pattern_duration()` call

### Improved
- **Unified boundary scanning**: Extracted shared `_scan_for_boundary()` from near-duplicate `_scan_for_intro` / `_scan_for_outro` methods
- **Exclusive bucket assignment**: Patterns now go into their single closest TF-IDF bucket instead of potentially landing in multiple overlapping buckets

### Added
- **Tests**: Boundary scanning (5 tests), duration estimation edge cases (6 tests), Claude feedback dedup (2 tests)

## [1.0.46] - 2026-03-11

### Improved
- **Pattern matching accuracy**: Paired boundary scanning -- when an intro phrase is matched, scan forward for the outro (and vice versa) before falling back to duration estimation
- **Duration tracking**: Patterns now store avg_duration and duration_samples; used for boundary estimation when paired phrase not found
- **Duration feedback from Claude**: When Claude detections overlap pattern regions >= 50%, pattern avg_duration is updated toward Claude's more accurate boundaries
- **Sentence-boundary extraction**: Intro/outro phrases extracted at sentence boundaries instead of naive word counts, improving fuzzy match quality
- **Proportional TF-IDF windows**: Short ad patterns scored against smaller windows (500-char buckets) instead of fixed 1500-char, reducing score dilution
- **Merge canonical selection**: merge_similar_patterns() now picks the highest confirmation_count pattern as canonical (length as tiebreaker)
- **Atomic confirmation counting**: record_pattern_match() uses increment_pattern_match() instead of race-prone read-then-write
- **Default ad duration estimate**: Increased from 60s to 90s to better match typical sponsor reads

## [1.0.45] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **Auto-processing self-match**: Dedup check in auto-process loop matched the episode's own record, preventing all new episodes from being queued. Added `episode_id != ep['id']` guard so dedup only triggers for genuinely different episode rows.
- **Duplicate episode rows from GUID changes**: `bulk_upsert_discovered_episodes` now checks for existing episodes with same title+date before inserting, preventing duplicate rows when RSS feeds change GUIDs. Backfills `episode_number` on existing rows if missing.
- **Sort broken for NULL `published_at`**: "Newest First" sort now uses `COALESCE(published_at, created_at)` so episodes with NULL `published_at` (from pre-v1.0.43 processing) sort by creation date instead of sinking to the bottom.
- **ON CONFLICT doesn't backfill NULL fields**: `bulk_upsert_discovered_episodes` ON CONFLICT clause now backfills NULL `published_at`, `original_url`, `title`, `description`, and `artwork_url` from RSS data without overwriting existing values.

## [1.0.44] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **Duplicate `db.get_episode` query in `serve_episode`**: `_lookup_episode()` now accepts an optional pre-fetched episode row, eliminating a redundant JOIN query on the DB fallback path.
- **Inaccurate log message**: Error log for episode not found now says "not found in RSS or database" instead of just "in RSS".
- **Type hint `List[Dict] = None`**: Changed to `Optional[List[Dict]] = None` in `modify_feed()` signature.
- **Redundant `get_podcast_by_slug` in `get_processed_episodes_for_feed`**: Method now accepts `podcast_id` directly instead of resolving slug internally, avoiding an unnecessary GROUP BY query when the caller already has the podcast dict.

## [1.0.43] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **Episode sort by episode number**: Episodes can now be sorted by episode number (from `itunes:episode` tag), publish date, or creation date. Sort dropdown on feed detail page with options: Newest First, Oldest First, Episode # High-Low, Episode # Low-High.
- **`episode_number` field**: Parsed from RSS `itunes:episode` tag end-to-end -- RSS parsing, DB storage, API response (`episodeNumber`), and RSS feed output.
- **`sort_by` / `sort_dir` API params**: `GET /api/v1/feeds/{slug}/episodes` now accepts `sort_by` (published_at, created_at, episode_number, title, status) and `sort_dir` (asc, desc).
- **Processed episodes appended beyond RSS cap**: RSS feed now appends processed episodes from the DB that fall outside the `max_episodes` cap. Podcast clients can see and download older processed episodes that would otherwise be invisible.
- **DB fallback for old episodes**: `_lookup_episode()` now falls back to the database when an episode is not in the upstream RSS feed (e.g., dropped off due to age/cap). On-demand processing works for any discovered episode.

### Fixed
- **Artwork missing after DB restore**: Feed refresh returning 304 (unchanged) now checks if artwork is cached. If artwork is missing (e.g., after a DB restore), forces a full fetch to re-extract and download artwork instead of returning early.
- **Artwork extraction missing itunes:image fallback**: Podcast-level artwork extraction now falls back to `itunes:image` when the standard RSS `<image>` tag is absent, matching the pattern already used for episode-level artwork in `rss_parser.py`.
- **Self-healing artwork endpoint**: When both the cached artwork file and `artwork_url` are missing (e.g., after extraction failures), the artwork endpoint now fetches the source RSS feed, extracts the artwork URL, persists it to the DB, and downloads the image on-demand instead of returning 404.
- **`return undefined as T` in apiRequest**: Changed to `return {} as T` to prevent runtime TypeError when callers destructure empty/204 responses.
- **`cleanup_old_episodes` crash with `storage=None`**: Now raises `ValueError` early instead of crashing with `AttributeError` deep in the call stack.
- **Bulk actions N+1 DB queries**: Replaced per-episode DB calls in `delete_episodes`, `bulk_episode_action` (process/reprocess/delete) with batch methods (`batch_clear_episode_details`, `batch_reset_episodes_to_discovered`, `batch_set_episodes_pending`). For 500 episodes, reduces ~2000 DB calls to ~3.
- **Artwork 404 for feeds with stale cache flag**: When artwork file is missing on disk but `artwork_cached=1` in DB, the artwork endpoint now clears the stale flag, re-extracts the URL from the source feed (including empty-string sentinels from prior failed extractions), and re-downloads. Also fixes `download_artwork` short-circuit that trusted the DB flag without verifying the file exists.
- **Processing overwrites `published_at` with NULL**: `serve_episode()` now passes `published_at` to background processing. `process_episode()` defensively skips `published_at` when None to avoid overwriting a good value. Fixes episodes dropping to bottom of "Newest First" sort during processing.

## [1.0.42] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed
- **Migration CASCADE data loss**: v1.0.41 migrations that rebuild the `episodes` table (DROP + recreate for CHECK constraints) triggered `ON DELETE CASCADE` on `episode_details`, destroying transcripts, ad markers, VTT, chapters, and LLM data. Migrations now disable `PRAGMA foreign_keys` before the DROP TABLE sequence and re-enable after commit.
- **304 bypass prevents episode discovery**: Feeds returning HTTP 304 (unchanged) now check for *discovered* episodes specifically (not total count). Feeds with only completed/processed episodes (zero discovered) correctly force a full fetch for initial discovery.
- **Console error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'payload')"**: `apiRequest` now guards against empty/non-JSON responses (204 No Content, missing content-type) instead of unconditionally calling `response.json()`.

### Removed
- Fallback placeholder UI for missing episode details (no longer needed with safe migration preserving data).

## [1.0.41] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- **Episode discovery**: All episodes from a feed are now surfaced in the MinusPod UI as `discovered` on every feed refresh. Users can process any episode at any time. Episode records persist indefinitely regardless of retention settings.
- **Bulk episode actions**: Select multiple episodes on the feed detail page and apply Process, Reprocess (Patterns + AI), Reprocess (Full), or Delete in one action. Bulk actions are page-scoped with per-action eligibility enforcement.
- **Episode pagination**: Feed detail episode list is paginated (default 25 per page, options: 25 / 50 / 100 / 500).
- **Per-feed RSS episode cap**: New `maxEpisodes` setting controls how many episodes are served to podcast clients (default 300, max 500). Configurable on add or via feed settings. Changing the cap triggers a full feed refresh.
- **Retention UI**: Retention period now configurable in Settings (days, or disabled).
- **`POST /api/v1/system/vacuum`**: Trigger SQLite VACUUM for manual disk space reclamation. API-only.
- **`POST /api/v1/feeds/{slug}/episodes/bulk`**: Bulk episode actions API.
- **`GET/PUT /api/v1/settings/retention`**: Retention configuration API.

### Changed
- **Retention behaviour**: Retention now deletes audio files and resets episodes to `discovered` instead of hard-deleting episode rows. Episode records, processing history, ad markers, and corrections are preserved. Measured in days (default 30) instead of minutes (default 1440). `RETENTION_PERIOD` env var is deprecated but still supported (converted from minutes on first startup).
- **RSS episode cap default raised**: From 100 to 300.
- **Episodes list default page size**: From 50 to 25. Max increased from 200 to 500.
- **Code quality**: Extracted `_reset_episode_to_discovered()` helper to eliminate 3x duplicated 10-field upsert calls. Extracted shared `EPISODE_STATUS_COLORS`/`EPISODE_STATUS_LABELS` constants from duplicated frontend dicts. Replaced N+1 `get_episode()` calls in bulk actions and `delete_episodes()` with batch `get_episodes_by_ids()` query. Removed dead fallback path in `cleanup_old_episodes()`. Simplified URLSearchParams construction in `getEpisodes()`.

### Fixed
- **0 episodes shown in UI for new feeds**: Episode records are now created on feed refresh rather than only on processing.
- **Feed history truncated to ~3-4 years**: Hardcoded 100-episode RSS cap raised and made configurable.
- **Retention deleting discovered episodes**: Retention now skips episodes with no files on disk, eliminating pointless DB churn.
- **processing_history orphaned by retention**: Episode rows are no longer hard-deleted, so processing_history rows always have a corresponding episode record.
- **Episode checkboxes outside card boundary on mobile**: Checkboxes now render inside the card at top-left with themed styling matching dark theme. Custom Checkbox component replaces native browser checkboxes.
- **Inconsistent episode card heights on mobile**: Removed JS `substring(0,150)` truncation that fought CSS `line-clamp-2`. Moved status badge to metadata row to prevent title wrapping.
- **Edit form (Network/DAI/Feed cap) overflows card on mobile**: Changed to stacked vertical layout with fixed-width labels.
- **"API Docs" link wraps on narrow Settings page**: Added `whitespace-nowrap` to prevent text breaking.

## [1.0.40] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed
- **HEAD requests triggering JIT processing**: Podcast clients (e.g. Pocket Casts) send HEAD requests during feed refresh to probe episode metadata. Flask auto-handles HEAD by running the full GET handler, which triggered the JIT processing pipeline for unprocessed episodes. HEAD requests on unprocessed episodes now proxy upstream audio headers without triggering processing. Completes the fix for #61 (auto-process queue path was fixed in v1.0.37-1.0.39, JIT path was not).

### Changed
- **Extracted `_lookup_episode()` helper**: Single RSS fetch+parse returns episode data and podcast name for both HEAD and GET paths, replacing the earlier `_get_original_episode_url()` which caused duplicate RSS fetches on the GET path.
- **Narrowed exception handling in `_head_upstream()`**: Catches `requests.exceptions.RequestException` instead of bare `Exception`.
- **Use centralized User-Agent**: `_head_upstream()` uses `APP_USER_AGENT` from config instead of hardcoded string.

## [1.0.39] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed
- **Silent worker death causing orphan-retry-exhaustion loop**: Episodes stuck in a death loop where Gunicorn SIGKILL (due to default 30s timeout) killed workers mid-processing, orphan detection incremented retry count, and after 3 cycles episodes were marked permanently_failed despite never truly failing.
- **Gunicorn timeout too short**: Added explicit `--timeout 600` (10min heartbeat) and `--graceful-timeout 330` (5min+30s buffer for graceful shutdown) to prevent premature SIGKILL during long audio processing.
- **graceful_shutdown blocking heartbeats**: Signal handler no longer blocks in a sleep loop waiting for processing to finish. Sets shutdown_event and returns immediately, letting Gunicorn's graceful-timeout manage the lifecycle.
- **Orphan resets penalizing retry count**: Both `reset_stuck_processing_episodes` (episodes table) and `reset_orphaned_queue_items` (auto_process_queue) no longer increment retry/attempt counters on orphan detection. Only actual processing failures increment counters.
- **Uncaught exceptions in _process_episode_background**: The outer `except Exception` handler now calls `_handle_processing_failure` for proper GPU cleanup, retry logic, and error recording instead of just logging.
- **"permanently failed" log spam**: Warning for permanently failed episodes on the serve route now only logs once per episode per process lifetime (subsequent requests log at DEBUG level).
- **OpenAPI spec missing `permanently_failed` status**: Added `permanently_failed` to the episode status enum in the `EpisodeSummary` schema and the `listEpisodes` status query parameter filter. Bumped spec version to 1.0.39.
- **Wasted DB query on every episode processing call**: Moved `db.get_episode()` (3-table JOIN) from the top of `_process_episode_background` into the `except` block where it is actually used, eliminating a redundant query on every happy-path and cancellation-path invocation.

## [1.0.38] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed
- **Auto-process race on feed creation**: New feeds could queue episodes for processing before the user could disable auto-process. The `POST /feeds` endpoint now accepts `autoProcessOverride` so the override is applied before the initial RSS refresh runs.
- **Cancel does not stop in-flight processing**: The cancel endpoint previously reset DB status but did not signal the running thread. Added cooperative cancellation using `threading.Event` with checkpoints between pipeline stages. Cancelling now actually stops the processing thread and cleans up partial output files.
- **Cancel endpoint race with background thread**: Cancel endpoint no longer resets DB status when a live thread is signalled -- the thread handles DB reset, file cleanup, and queue release to prevent re-queue races. Endpoint only does direct cleanup as a stuck-episode fallback.
- **Duplicated auto_process_override conversion**: Extracted `_serialize_auto_process` / `_deserialize_auto_process` helpers replacing identical 6-line if/elif blocks in 3 API endpoints. Non-boolean values now consistently map to None.

### Added
- **Auto-process dropdown on Add Feed page**: Users can set auto-process to "Always Enable", "Always Disable", or "Use Global Setting" when adding a feed, eliminating the race window.
- **Cancel module** (`cancel.py`): Extracted cancel primitives (event registry, `ProcessingCancelled`, `_check_cancel`, `cancel_processing`) from `main.py` for independent testability without Flask/CUDA imports.
- **Unit tests for cancel and serialization**: 22 new tests covering cancel mechanism (signal, no-op, isolation, cleanup) and auto-process override serialization (roundtrips, edge cases).

## [1.0.37] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed
- **Auto-process "Always Disable" not respected (#61)**: Queue processor now checks `is_auto_process_enabled_for_podcast()` before processing each dequeued episode. Episodes queued before the setting was changed are marked completed and skipped.
- **Database lock errors on fresh install (#62)**: Added file-lock leader election so only one Gunicorn worker starts background threads (RSS refresh, queue processor). Prevents duplicate threads across worker processes from causing SQLite write contention.
- **Defensive mkdir for lock file**: Lock file directory is now created before opening, preventing failures in non-Docker environments where DATA_DIR may not exist yet.
- **Initial RSS refresh runs in all workers**: Moved initial feed refresh inside the leader-election block so only the leader worker performs it, avoiding SQLite contention on startup.

### Added
- **Audiobookshelf documentation**: Added README note about Audiobookshelf's SSRF filter blocking local MinusPod instances, with `SSRF_REQUEST_FILTER_WHITELIST` configuration instructions.
- **Audiobookshelf ToC entry**: Added Audiobookshelf subsection link to README Table of Contents.

## [1.0.36] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed
- **Thread-safe provider cache**: Added `threading.Lock` to protect `_provider_cache` reads, writes, and clears in `llm_client.py`, preventing race conditions under concurrent requests.
- **Reset settings consistency**: `reset_ad_detection_settings()` now uses `db.reset_setting()` for `llm_provider` and `openai_base_url` instead of manually re-deriving env var defaults, matching the pattern used by every other setting in the function.
- **URL format validation**: `openaiBaseUrl` setting now validated via `urlparse` before storing -- rejects values without a valid `http://` or `https://` scheme or missing hostname.
- **Security subtitle clarity**: Settings Security section shows "No password set - app is publicly accessible" instead of bare "No password set".
- **LLM message logging**: Multi-part (list-type) message content now extracts text parts for readable debug logs instead of dumping raw `str()` representation, in both Anthropic and OpenAI-compatible clients.

### Changed
- **Provider constants ordering**: `PROVIDER_ANTHROPIC`, `PROVIDER_OPENAI_COMPATIBLE`, `PROVIDER_OLLAMA`, `PROVIDERS_NON_ANTHROPIC` moved before the functions that reference them in `llm_client.py`.
- **CollapsibleSection useEffect comment**: Added explanatory comment for the intentional missing dependency array on the re-measure `useEffect`.

## [1.0.35] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- **Provider-aware API key badge**: Settings UI now shows muted "Not required" badge for Ollama and OpenAI-compatible providers instead of a misleading yellow "Not configured" warning.
- **Provider-aware model injection**: `_ensure_configured_models_present()` no longer injects stale model IDs from a previous provider (e.g. claude-* models no longer appear in Ollama model dropdowns after switching providers).
- **Password input autocomplete warnings**: Added `autoComplete` attributes to Settings page password inputs (`current-password`, `new-password`) to resolve Chrome DevTools DOM warnings and improve password manager integration.

### Changed
- **Refresh button label**: Model refresh button now shows "Refresh" text alongside the icon (and "Refreshing..." with spinner when loading) instead of being icon-only.
- **Provider string constants**: Replaced all inline `'anthropic'`/`'openai-compatible'`/`'ollama'` string literals with named constants (`PROVIDER_ANTHROPIC`, `PROVIDER_OLLAMA`, `PROVIDERS_NON_ANTHROPIC` in backend; `LLM_PROVIDERS` + `LlmProvider` type in frontend). Eliminates typo risk and centralizes provider vocabulary.
- **hasChanges derived value**: Settings page `hasChanges` converted from `useState`+`useEffect` to `useMemo`, removing stale-state edge case after save.
- **Inline spinners consolidated**: Replaced hand-rolled SVG spinner in Settings refresh button and border spinner in AddFeed OPML import with shared `LoadingSpinner` component (new `inline` prop).
- **Duplicate pricing code extracted**: `_enrich_models_with_pricing()` helper replaces identical try/except blocks in `get_available_models()` and `refresh_models()` API routes.

## [1.0.34] - 2026-03-02

### Added
- **Runtime LLM provider switching**: `LLM_PROVIDER` and `OPENAI_BASE_URL` are now stored in the database and configurable via the settings UI. No container restart required to switch between Anthropic, Ollama, or OpenAI-compatible providers.
- **LLM Provider settings section**: New "LLM Provider" section in settings with provider dropdown, base URL input (for non-Anthropic), and API key status badge.
- **Model refresh endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/settings/models/refresh` forces a fresh model list fetch from the active provider. Refresh button added to AI Models section header.
- **Empty models warning**: Yellow banner in AI Models section when the provider returns no models, guiding users to check configuration.
- **LLM I/O logging**: New `podcast.llm_io` logger captures full request/response data at DEBUG level and metadata (model, token counts, response length) at INFO level. Uses intelligent truncation (head 80% + tail 20%) for large content.
- **Collapsible settings sections**: Settings page redesigned with 10 collapsible sections (persisted to localStorage). Reduces visual clutter and improves mobile usability.
- **Sticky save bar**: Save/Reset buttons now appear in a fixed bottom bar when changes are pending, always reachable regardless of scroll position.

### Changed
- **Settings page consolidation**: Merged 12 separate cards into 10 collapsible sections. AI Model, Verification Pass, and Chapters Model merged into single "AI Models" section. Audio Output Quality and Audio Analysis merged into "Audio" section. Ad Detection Aggressiveness and Auto-Process merged into "Ad Detection" section.
- **Responsive prompt textareas**: Reduced from 12 rows to 6 on mobile for better viewport utilization.
- **Provider reads centralized**: All `os.environ.get('LLM_PROVIDER')` calls replaced with `get_effective_provider()` which checks DB first with 5s TTL cache. Same for base URL via `get_effective_base_url()`.

### Removed
- **Fallback models list**: `FALLBACK_MODELS` hardcoded list removed from `llm_client.py`. Both `AnthropicClient` and `OpenAICompatibleClient` now return empty lists on API failure instead of stale fallbacks, making provider misconfiguration immediately visible.

## [1.0.33] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- **Provider-aware model seeds**: `_seed_default_settings()` now uses `LLM_PROVIDER` and `OPENAI_MODEL` env vars when seeding `verification_model` and `chapters_model`. Fresh Ollama installs no longer get hardcoded Anthropic model names that would 404.
- **Provider-aware `reset_setting()`**: Resetting `claude_model`, `verification_model`, or `chapters_model` now respects `LLM_PROVIDER`/`OPENAI_MODEL` instead of always resetting to Anthropic constants.
- **Non-Anthropic provider timeouts**: `get_llm_timeout()` and `get_llm_max_retries()` now apply extended timeouts/reduced retries for all non-Anthropic providers (`openai-compatible`, `wrapper`, `ollama`), not just `ollama`.
- **UI staleness after processing**: `GlobalStatusBar` SSE handler now invalidates React Query caches when a job completes or a feed refresh finishes, so `FeedDetail`, `EpisodeDetail`, and `Dashboard` auto-update without manual refresh.

### Changed
- **README**: Renamed "Claude Model" to "AI Model" in settings docs to match UI. Fixed `OPENAI_MODEL` env var table to show no default (was misleadingly showing the Anthropic model name).

## [1.0.32] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- **Chapters model DB lookup broken**: `get_chapters_model()` used `from database import PodcastDatabase` but the class is actually `Database`. Both the `chapters_model` and `claude_model` DB lookups silently failed via the caught exception, causing the function to always fall through to the hardcoded Anthropic model name -- breaking Ollama setups even after the 1.0.31 provider-aware fallback was added.

## [1.0.31] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- **TextPatternMatcher vectorizer crash**: Guard `_load_patterns()` against None vectorizer. When `skip_patterns=True` (AI-only reprocess mode), `_ensure_initialized()` was never called, but pattern creation still triggered `_load_patterns()` which called `self._vectorizer.fit()` on None. Now auto-initializes the vectorizer on demand, with a graceful fallback if sklearn is unavailable.
- **Chapters model 404 on Ollama**: `get_chapters_model()` now falls back to the user's primary detection model (`claude_model` DB setting) when `LLM_PROVIDER` is not `anthropic`, instead of hardcoding `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` which Ollama doesn't have.

### Added
- **Chapters model DB seed**: `_seed_default_settings()` now seeds `chapters_model` with a provider-aware default so fresh Ollama installs get a valid model out of the box.
- **README table of contents**: Added a linked table of contents for easier navigation.

## [1.0.30] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- **Ollama single-object response parsing**: qwen3 (and potentially other models) return a bare JSON object `{...}` instead of an array `[{...}]` when detecting a single ad. The parser now detects objects with start/end timestamp keys and wraps them in an array, preventing silent ad drops. Anthropic code path is unaffected (always returns arrays).

### Added
- **LLM response logging**: Raw LLM response text is now logged at INFO level (first 500 chars) for both detection and verification windows. Enables debugging unexpected model output via Grafana without needing to query the database.
- **Reasoning field logging**: `OpenAICompatibleClient` now logs the presence and size of reasoning/chain-of-thought fields (e.g. qwen3 think mode) at DEBUG level.

### Changed
- **README model tables**: Replaced single flat model recommendation table with per-pass tables (Pass 1 / Verification / Chapters) reflecting that different passes have different model requirements.

## [1.0.29] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- **Ollama LLM timeouts**: Made LLM request timeouts and retry counts provider-aware. Ollama/local models now get 600s timeout (up from 120s) and 2 retries (down from 3) since local inference is much slower than cloud APIs. Fixes `Window N API error: Request timed out` when using `LLM_PROVIDER=ollama`.
- **Chapters generator missing timeout**: All 3 LLM calls in `chapters_generator.py` previously inherited the 120s default timeout. Now explicitly pass the provider-aware timeout.

### Added
- `LLM_TIMEOUT_DEFAULT`, `LLM_TIMEOUT_LOCAL`, `LLM_RETRY_MAX_RETRIES`, `LLM_RETRY_MAX_RETRIES_LOCAL` constants in `config.py`
- `get_llm_timeout()` and `get_llm_max_retries()` helpers in `llm_client.py`

## [1.0.28] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- **Ollama model listing 404**: Auto-append `/v1` to `OPENAI_BASE_URL` when `LLM_PROVIDER=ollama` and the URL doesn't already end with `/v1`. Fixes 404 errors on model listing and chat completions (`GET /models` -> `GET /v1/models`).
- **Ollama native fallback**: Added `_try_ollama_native_list()` method that queries Ollama's native `/api/tags` endpoint as a fallback when the OpenAI-compatible `/v1/models` endpoint fails. Used in both model listing and connection verification.

### Changed
- **Generic LLM naming in UI**: Replaced all user-facing "Claude" references with "AI" in Settings page ("AI Model"), EpisodeDetail reprocess buttons ("Patterns + AI", "Skip patterns, AI only"), and FeedDetail reprocess menus/modals.
- **Generic LLM naming in API docs**: Updated OpenAPI spec to use "AI model" / "AI analysis" instead of "Claude" in descriptions for model selection, reprocess modes, settings, and confidence fields. Example model values kept as-is.

## [1.0.27] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- **Configurable chapters model**: Chapter generation no longer hardcodes Haiku. New `chapters_model` DB setting with `get_chapters_model()` function, exposed via Settings API and UI dropdown (visible when chapters are enabled). Defaults to `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` for Anthropic users; Ollama users can select any available model.

### Changed
- **Ollama recommended models table**: Updated README table with Qwen 3.5 family models, added "Size on Disk" column, refreshed entries across all VRAM tiers.

## [1.0.26] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- **Ollama model filter**: Removed name-based filter in `OpenAICompatibleClient.list_models()` that only showed models containing "claude", "gpt", or "llama". All models reported by the endpoint are now listed, so Ollama models like qwen3, mistral, and phi4-mini appear correctly.
- **Ollama fallback models**: `OpenAICompatibleClient._get_fallback_models()` now returns the configured `OPENAI_MODEL` value instead of hardcoded Claude models.
- **Ollama startup blocked by API key check**: `get_api_key()` now defaults to `"not-needed"` for non-anthropic providers. `verify_llm_connection()` restructured so Ollama/openai-compatible providers skip the API key gate and go straight to the endpoint connection test.
- **README env var table**: Added `ollama` as a valid `LLM_PROVIDER` value. Added missing `OPENAI_MODEL` row.

### Added
- **README Ollama section**: Dedicated documentation covering Ollama setup, recommended models by VRAM tier, accuracy comparison vs Claude, and JSON reliability risks.

## [1.0.25] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- **README accuracy**: Merged "System Status" bullet into "Settings" (it is a section within Settings, not a standalone page)
- **Frontend README**: Updated outdated component reference from `TranscriptEditor.tsx` to `AdEditor.tsx`
- **OpenAPI spec version**: Updated from 1.0.0 to match actual app version
- **OpenAPI corrections endpoint**: Fixed path from `/feeds/{slug}/episodes/{episodeId}/corrections` to `/episodes/{slug}/{episodeId}/corrections` to match api.py
- **OpenAPI reprocess endpoint**: Fixed path from `/feeds/{slug}/episodes/{episodeId}/reprocess` to `/episodes/{slug}/{episodeId}/reprocess` to match preferred endpoint with mode support

## [1.0.24] - 2026-03-01

### Changed
- **Updated README**: Renamed "Transcript Editor" section to "Ad Editor" with updated feature descriptions covering time adjustment controls, reason panel, pill selector, and audio auto-seek. Removed outdated transcript-specific features (swipe gestures, double-tap/long-press boundary setting).
- **Refreshed all screenshots**: Recaptured all 15 desktop and mobile screenshots from the live server reflecting the current UI with MinusPod logo, updated ad editor layout, and new time controls.

## [1.0.23] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- **Audio seek on ad switch**: Clicking ad pills, navigating with next/prev, or auto-advancing after confirm/save now seeks the audio to the new ad's start time. Previously the progress bar stayed at its old position.

### Changed
- **Mobile bottom sheet redesign**: Start/End time controls now stack vertically (one per row) instead of side-by-side, fixing cut-off inputs on narrow screens. Progress bar moved to top of bottom sheet for full width. Action buttons use full-width flex row with inline icon+text. Input font bumped to 16px (text-base) for readability. Reduced internal padding (px-3) to reclaim screen space on mobile.
- **Desktop time controls visibility**: Stepper buttons use filled bg-muted background instead of ghost border for clearer interactivity. Labels uppercase with tracking. Icons and text use text-foreground instead of text-muted-foreground.
- **Tighter mobile spacing**: Header, pill selector, reason panel, and grab handle all use reduced padding on mobile (px-3/py-2.5) while preserving desktop padding (px-4/py-3).

## [1.0.20] - 2026-03-01

### Changed
- **AdEditor layout cleanup**: Replaced fixed height container (h-[85dvh]/h-[70vh]) with content-driven max-h sizing so the popup shrinks to fit content. Unified pill selector across all viewports (removed desktop-only chevron navigation). Moved time adjustment controls from sticky top header into desktop bottom bar and mobile bottom sheet. Reason panel no longer stretches with flex-1. Removed sticky positioning since the container no longer needs scroll context. Time controls styled with rounded-md border border-border to match action buttons.

## [1.0.19] - 2026-02-28

### Changed
- **Redesigned ad editor time adjustment controls**: +/- buttons use bg-muted filled style matching the rest of the UI instead of hard-bordered containers. Always visible on all viewports (removed collapsible mobile toggle). Minus/Plus icons, inline "s" suffix, no browser number spinners.
- **Replaced transcript panel with reason panel**: The scrollable transcript view in the ad editor is replaced by an always-visible panel showing why an ad was flagged, its confidence percentage, and detection stage. Removed VTT fetch/parse, touch mode toggles, swipe gestures, and segment click handlers.
- **Renamed TranscriptEditor to AdEditor**: Component, file, props interface, and all references updated to reflect its actual purpose as an ad review/correction editor.

## [1.0.18] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- **MinusPod logo in UI**: Header and login page now display the MinusPod logo (audio waveform bars with strike-through and wordmark) instead of plain text, with theme-aware light/dark variants
- **New favicon**: Replaced generic microphone icon with the MinusPod waveform icon extracted from the logo
- **README logo**: Added centered MinusPod logo at the top of README.md

## [1.0.17] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed
- **Thread safety for per-episode token accumulator**: Replaced shared module-level dict with `threading.local()` so each thread (background processor, HTTP handler) gets an independent accumulator. Prevents concurrent requests from corrupting each other's token counts under Gunicorn's `--threads 8`.
- **Missing try/finally for token tracking in standalone API endpoints**: `/regenerate-chapters` and `/retry-ad-detection` now wrap LLM calls in `try/finally` so `get_episode_token_totals()` and DB persistence always run even if the LLM call raises.

## [1.0.16] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed
- **Standalone API endpoints not tracking per-episode token usage**: `/regenerate-chapters` and `/retry-ad-detection` make LLM calls outside the processing pipeline without activating the per-episode token accumulator. Global `token_usage` table recorded these calls, but they were invisible in per-episode cost display. Both endpoints now activate `start_episode_token_tracking()` before LLM calls and persist totals via `increment_episode_token_usage()`.

### Added
- **`increment_episode_token_usage()` database method**: Increments `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, and `llm_cost` on the most recent completed `processing_history` entry for an episode. Used by standalone endpoints that make LLM calls after the initial processing run.

## [1.0.15] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed
- **Processing history not saved due to SQL column mismatch**: `record_processing_history()` INSERT had 14 columns but only 13 VALUES placeholders -- the `?` for `llm_cost` was missing. All processing runs since v1.0.12 silently failed to write history rows (caught by try/except, logged as "Failed to record history: 13 values for 14 columns"). Token accumulator was working correctly but data was discarded at the DB write step.

## [1.0.14] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed
- **Always show LLM cost on episode detail page**: Previously hidden when tokens were zero (all pre-feature episodes). Now displays `LLM: $0.00 (0 in / 0 out)` for any completed episode with a processing_history entry.
- **2-digit cost precision in UI**: Changed LLM cost display from 4 decimal places to 2 in both episode detail and history pages for cleaner presentation.

### Added
- **Diagnostic logging for token accumulator lifecycle**: Added logging at accumulator activation, each token callback, and totals retrieval in `llm_client.py`. Added token totals logging before DB write in `main.py` for both success and failure paths. Enables verification via Loki after next processing run.

## [1.0.13] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed
- **Episode detail LLM cost placement**: Moved LLM cost/token display from inside the "Detected Ads" card (hidden when 0 ads found) to the episode metadata bar alongside date, duration, and status badges. Now visible on any processed episode regardless of ad count.
- **Episode token display suppressed when cost is zero**: `_get_episode_token_fields` was checking `llm_cost == 0.0` to hide the display, but models without pricing entries have $0 cost with non-zero tokens. Now checks for zero tokens instead.
- **Missing pricing for `claude-sonnet-4-6`**: Added to `DEFAULT_MODEL_PRICING` ($3/$15 per MTok). Previously all calls to this model recorded $0 cost.

## [1.0.12] - 2026-02-26

### Added
- **Per-episode LLM token usage and cost tracking**: Every processing run now records input/output token counts and estimated cost directly in `processing_history`. Module-level accumulator in `llm_client.py` aggregates all LLM calls during a single episode's processing pipeline (ad detection, verification, chapters) and passes totals to `record_processing_history()` on completion or failure.
- **Episode detail LLM cost display**: Episode detail page shows LLM cost and token breakdown (e.g. "LLM: $0.0034 (12.3K in / 1.5K out)") when cost data is available.
- **History page cost column**: New sortable "Cost" column in the processing history table shows per-episode LLM cost. Stats summary includes a "Total LLM Cost" tile.
- **Token data in API responses**: `GET /api/v1/feeds/{slug}/episodes/{id}` includes `inputTokens`, `outputTokens`, `llmCost`. History list, stats, and export endpoints include the same fields.
- **Database migration**: Adds `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `llm_cost` columns to `processing_history` table with zero defaults for backward compatibility.

## [1.0.11] - 2026-02-26

### Added
- **LLM token usage tracking with cost calculation**: Every LLM API call (ad detection, verification, chapters) now records input/output token counts and estimated cost. Tracks per-model breakdown in `token_usage` table with pricing from `model_pricing` table seeded with current Anthropic rates. Usage callback wired into `LLMClient` base class so all call sites are tracked automatically with zero code changes.
- **New API endpoint `GET /api/v1/system/token-usage`**: Returns global totals (input/output tokens, total cost) and per-model breakdown with pricing info.
- **LLM Tokens and LLM Cost tiles in System Status**: Settings page now shows cumulative token usage (formatted as "1.2M in / 456K out") and total USD cost alongside existing stats.
- **Model pricing refresh on `GET /settings/models`**: Newly discovered models are automatically priced from built-in defaults when the model list is fetched.
- **New API endpoint `GET /api/v1/system/model-pricing`**: Returns all known model pricing rates from the `model_pricing` table for API consumers.
- **Pricing enrichment on `GET /settings/models`**: Model list response now includes `inputCostPerMtok` and `outputCostPerMtok` fields when pricing is known.
- **Cost display in model dropdowns**: Settings page model selectors show per-token pricing inline (e.g. "Claude Haiku 4.5 ($1 / $5 per MTok)").

## [1.0.10] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed
- **Age limit on auto-retry for failed queue items**: `reset_failed_queue_items()` now skips items older than 48 hours (configurable via `max_age_hours`). Previously, ancient failed items with elapsed backoff timers were retried on first run, causing 8 stale episodes to be reprocessed on v1.0.9 deploy.

## [1.0.9] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- **Auto-retry for failed queue items in background_queue_processor**: Failed auto-process queue items are now automatically retried with exponential backoff (5/15/45 min). Previously, failed episodes were only retried when a podcast client happened to request them. Respects `MAX_EPISODE_RETRIES` limit and skips permanently failed episodes.

## [1.0.8] - 2026-02-21

### Changed
- **Tightened "WHAT IS NOT AN AD" host mention rule**: Added "organically" qualifier and conversational context to the host self-promotion exclusion in both system and verification prompts, preventing produced cross-promos from being incorrectly excluded
- **Removed blanket network cross-promo exclusion from verification prompt**: The rule "Cross-promotion of shows within the same podcast network (unless it includes promo codes or external URLs)" was too broad and caused produced promo segments to be missed

### Added
- **"PLATFORM-INSERTED ADS" section in both prompts**: New detection guidance for hosting platform pre/post-rolls (Acast, Spotify for Podcasters, iHeart Radio), cross-promotions for other podcasts, and network promos with clear distinction between organic host mentions and produced promotional segments
- **DB migration to auto-update default prompts on existing installs**: Migration uses `PLATFORM-INSERTED ADS` sentinel to detect old prompts and only updates if `is_default` is set (custom prompts are preserved)

## [1.0.7] - 2026-02-19

### Security
- **SSRF protection for outbound requests**: User-supplied feed URLs (via `add_feed` and `import_opml`) and second-order URLs from RSS content (artwork, audio) are now validated before any outbound request. Blocks private/reserved IPs, loopback, link-local, cloud metadata endpoints (169.254.169.254, 168.63.129.16), restricted schemes (only http/https allowed), and non-standard ports. Validation applied at API entry points and as defense-in-depth in `rss_parser.py`, `storage.py`, and `transcriber.py`.
- **Stored XSS fix in search snippets**: FTS5 search snippets containing unsanitized RSS description HTML are now sanitized server-side via `nh3` (only `<mark>` tags preserved). Frontend `Search.tsx` replaced unsafe innerHTML rendering with a safe React rendering helper that splits on `<mark>` boundaries and renders all other content as escaped text.

### Added
- `src/utils/url.py` -- SSRF URL validation module (`validate_url`, `SSRFError`)
- `ALLOWED_URL_SCHEMES` and `ALLOWED_URL_PORTS` constants in `src/utils/constants.py`
- `nh3` dependency for HTML sanitization

## [1.0.6] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed
- **`parse_timestamp` silently returning 0.0 on bad input**: Restored `ValueError` on unparseable timestamps (regression from v1.0.3 consolidation). All 7 callers with `try/except ValueError` were effectively dead code; garbage timestamps silently became 0.0 (episode start), creating false markers at time zero.
- **Permanent LLM errors retried indefinitely**: Added early `return False` in `is_retryable_error()` for non-retryable Anthropic/OpenAI status codes, preventing fallthrough to string-pattern matching. Added `is_llm_api_error()` helper and guard in `is_transient_error()` so permanent API errors (e.g. `BadRequestError`, `AuthenticationError`) are not misclassified as transient.
- **Stale schema comment on `pattern_corrections` table**: Updated from "audit log ... never deleted" to reflect that conflicting entries are cleaned up on reversal (v1.0.5 behavior).

## [1.0.5] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed
- **Conflicting corrections not cleaned up on user action reversal**: When a user changed their mind about a correction (e.g., marked false positive then confirmed, or vice versa), both corrections persisted in the database. The false_positive check has higher priority in validation, so a confirm could never override a prior false_positive for the same segment. Now `delete_conflicting_corrections()` removes the opposite correction type (with 50% overlap match) before inserting the new one.
- **Misleading flag prefix in ad_validator.py**: Changed "ERROR: User marked as false positive" to "INFO:" since this is an intentional user action, not an error condition.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-02-18

### Fixed
- **ChaptersGenerator `self.client` AttributeError**: Replaced 4 remaining references to the removed `client` backward-compat property with `self._llm_client` (the actual backing field). Regression introduced in v1.0.3 Phase D item 21 when backward-compatibility aliases were removed.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-02-18

### Changed (Code Simplification)

- **Consolidated duplicate `parse_timestamp` implementations**: Merged 3 separate versions (utils/time.py, ad_detector.py, chapters_generator.py) into a single canonical version in `utils/time.py` that handles all input types (int, float, string with 's' suffix, HH:MM:SS, MM:SS, VTT comma decimals).
- **Consolidated duplicate `adjust_timestamp` implementations**: Merged transcript_generator.py and chapters_generator.py versions into `utils/time.py`. Both modules now import the shared function.
- **Consolidated duplicate `format_vtt_timestamp`**: Merged transcriber.py and transcript_generator.py versions into `utils/time.py` (HH:MM:SS.mmm format).
- **Consolidated `FALLBACK_MODELS` list**: Defined once in `llm_client.py` at module level, replacing 3 identical lists in AnthropicClient, OpenAICompatibleClient, and AdDetector.
- **Simplified `is_transient_error` in main.py**: Now delegates LLM API error classification to `llm_client.is_retryable_error()` instead of duplicating the logic.
- **Moved `first_not_none` to utils/time.py**: Extracted from ad_detector.py for reuse; critical for preserving 0.0 pre-roll timestamps.
- **Consolidated FFPROBE_TIMEOUT**: utils/audio.py now imports from config.py instead of defining its own copy.
- **Consolidated User-Agent strings**: Added `BROWSER_USER_AGENT` and `APP_USER_AGENT` constants to config.py; updated storage.py, rss_parser.py, and transcriber.py.
- **Decomposed `process_episode()` (~640 lines)**: Extracted 7 named pipeline stage functions (`_download_and_transcribe`, `_run_audio_analysis`, `_detect_ads_first_pass`, `_refine_and_validate`, `_run_verification_pass`, `_generate_assets`, `_finalize_episode`) plus `_handle_processing_failure`. The orchestrator is now ~70 lines.
- **Extracted `_extract_json_ads_array()` from `_parse_ads_from_response()`**: 4 JSON extraction strategies (direct parse, markdown code block, regex scan, bracket fallback) now in a dedicated method.
- **Simplified `_run_schema_migrations()` (~590 lines -> ~120 lines)**: Added `_add_column_if_missing()`, `_rename_column_if_needed()`, and `_get_table_columns()` helpers. All 25+ repetitive ALTER TABLE blocks replaced with data-driven lists.
- **Updated hardcoded model in chapters_generator.py**: Replaced `"claude-3-5-haiku-20241022"` with configurable `CHAPTERS_MODEL` constant set to `"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001"`.
- **Merged identical `complete_job()`/`fail_job()` in status_service.py**: Both now delegate to shared `_clear_current_job()`.
- **Extracted common overlap check in ad_validator.py**: `_overlaps_false_positive()` and `_overlaps_confirmed()` now delegate to parameterized `_overlaps_corrections()`.
- **Fixed overly broad auth path exemptions in api.py**: Changed `/rss` substring check to `path.endswith('/rss')` and scoped `/audio` and `/artwork` checks to `/api/v1/feeds/` prefix.
- **Moved inline stdlib imports to module level**: `import re` and `import math` in api.py, `import time` in database.py.
- **Added `transaction()` context manager to Database**: Provides `with db.transaction() as conn:` for automatic commit/rollback.
- **Removed backward-compatibility aliases**: `get_podcast()` in database.py, `client` properties in ad_detector.py and chapters_generator.py.
- **Removed unnecessary ImportError guards**: Local module imports in ad_detector.py lazy properties (audio_fingerprinter, text_pattern_matcher, pattern_service, sponsor_service) no longer wrapped in try/except ImportError.
- **Added VTT parse failure logging**: transcript_generator.py now warns when VTT parsing returns empty segments.
- **Removed `parse_timestamp_to_seconds()` wrapper**: chapters_generator.py callers now use `parse_timestamp()` directly from utils.time.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-02-18

### Fixed
- **Missed tagline-style DAI ads**: Added detection guidance for short (15-45s) brand tagline
  ads that lack promo codes or URLs -- polished radio-commercial-style spots with concentrated
  marketing language. Added synthetic example to prompt and GNC to brand list. DB migration
  auto-updates default prompts (preserves user customizations).
- **Claude timestamp hallucination**: New `validate_ad_timestamps()` checks whether ad keywords
  actually appear at the reported transcript position. If not, searches the window for the
  correct location and corrects the timestamps before downstream filtering.
- **Pattern-overlap filtering silently dropping uncovered tails**: Replaced binary
  `_is_region_covered()` with `get_uncovered_portions()` in the Claude/pattern merge loop.
  Uncovered portions >= 15s are now preserved as separate ad segments instead of being
  discarded when a pattern covers >50% of a merged Claude ad.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed
- **Rejected ad not restored after user confirmation**: Four cascading bugs prevented
  user "Confirm as Ad" corrections from taking effect on reprocess.
  - `NOT_AD_PATTERNS` regex false positive: "transition from show content" in ad reasons
    incorrectly triggered rejection. Replaced negative lookbehind with positive assertion.
  - Confirmed corrections ignored during reprocessing: Added `get_confirmed_corrections()`
    to database and `_overlaps_confirmed()` to validator. Confirmed ads now force-accept
    at confidence 1.0 (priority: false_positive REJECT > confirmed ACCEPT > normal).
  - Frontend omitted `sponsor` field from correction payload, preventing sponsor
    extraction on the backend.
  - Confirm handler sponsor extraction used adjusted timestamps against original
    timestamps. Added reason-text fallback before transcript-based extraction.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-14

Major release: pipeline redesign, MinusPod rebrand, and ad detection overhaul.

### Changed
- **Renamed to MinusPod**: Service name, Docker image (`ttlequals0/minuspod`), frontend title, package name, API docs, README, and deployment docs all updated from "Podcast Server" / "podcast-server".
- **Replaced two-pass architecture with verification pipeline**: The blind second pass is replaced by a post-cut verification pass that re-transcribes processed audio and runs detection with a "what doesn't belong" prompt. Missed ads are re-cut directly from pass 1 output.
- **Audio signals as Claude prompt context**: Volume anomalies and DAI transition pairs are formatted as text and injected into Claude's per-window prompts instead of running as an independent post-detection step. Claude makes all ad/not-ad decisions with full audio evidence.
- **Audio analysis always enabled**: Removed global `audioAnalysisEnabled` toggle and per-feed `audioAnalysisOverride`. Volume analysis via ffmpeg is lightweight and always runs.
- **AdMarker schema updated**: `pass` field replaced with `detection_stage` enum covering first_pass, claude, fingerprint, text_pattern, language, audio_enforced, and verification stages.
- **Confidence slider is single source of truth**: Removed hardcoded dual-thresholds that bypassed the user's min_cut_confidence slider. ACCEPT = always cut, REJECT = never cut, REVIEW = confidence gate.
- **Detection prompts rewritten**: Removed "when in doubt, mark it as an ad" bias. Both passes require identifiable promotional language. Added "WHAT IS NOT AN AD" guidance and "AUDIO SIGNALS" evidence-only framing.
- **Transition detection threshold raised from 3.5 dB to 12.0 dB**: Added delta-ratio symmetry filter and recalibrated confidence formula to eliminate false positives from normal audio variation.
- **Pattern learning quality gates**: Only creates patterns from ads that were actually cut. Sponsor extraction uses 4-tier DB resolution with prefix and short-word rejection gates.

### Added
- **Abrupt transition detection**: New `TransitionDetector` analyzes frame-to-frame loudness jumps in existing volume analyzer output. Pairs up/down transitions into candidate DAI regions.
- **Audio signal enforcement**: New `AudioEnforcer` formats audio signals for Claude prompts and extends existing ad boundaries when signals partially overlap.
- **Verification pass module**: New `VerificationPass` class encapsulates the full post-cut pipeline with separate model selection.
- **Heuristic pre/post-roll detection**: New `roll_detector.py` with regex-based detection for ads at episode boundaries that Claude missed. Requires 2+ pattern matches.
- **Transcript generation**: New `TranscriptGenerator` produces timestamp-aligned text stored in the database for search indexing and UI display.
- **Silent-gap ad merge**: Consecutive ads separated by up to 30s of silence (no speech) are merged into a single ad instead of requiring 5s proximity.
- **Incremental search index updates**: Episodes indexed immediately after processing; full rebuild every 6 hours.
- **VTT-based transcript timestamps in UI**: EpisodeDetail fetches actual VTT transcript for accurate timestamps instead of approximating.
- **Sponsor field on ad markers**: Ad markers now store the `sponsor` field separately for UI sponsor badges. Window deduplication preserves sponsor names during merges.

### Fixed
- **Pre-roll ads at 0.0s silently dropped**: Python `or`-chains treated `0.0` as falsy; replaced with `_first_not_none()` helper.
- **Pass 2 ads missing from UI and showing wrong timestamps**: Multiple fixes for verification ads not being saved or displaying with processed-audio timestamps instead of original coordinates.
- **Ad marker reasons showing bare sponsor names**: Three independent merge/dedup bugs caused markers to display unhelpful reasons instead of descriptive text.
- **Corrupt fingerprints causing stuck episodes**: Auto-detection and deletion of broken fingerprints; bail-out when all fingerprints are corrupt.
- **CTranslate2 cuDNN crash**: Added `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` for nvidia pip package directories.
- **Content segments parsed as ads**: Dynamic ad-evidence validation requires positive proof (known sponsor, ad-language patterns, or explicit sponsor field).

### Removed
- **Speaker diarization and music bed detection**: Dropped pyannote.audio and librosa dependencies. GPU memory pressure, processing time, and heavy dependencies for marginal benefit.
- **Dependencies**: `librosa`, `pyannote.audio`, `nvidia-cudnn-cu12` (re-added then managed via LD_LIBRARY_PATH).
- **Dead code**: Unused functions, blind second pass prompt, stale UI text, audio analysis toggle settings.

## [0.1.258] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed
- **Missing sponsor names and raw detection_stage in UI**: Claude-detected ads now store the `sponsor` field separately (extracted via `extract_sponsor_name`) so the UI can display sponsor badges. Window deduplication preserves sponsor names during merges. Frontend passes through `marker.sponsor` from the API instead of hardcoding `undefined`. TranscriptEditor maps raw `detection_stage` values to human-friendly labels (Pass 1, Pass 2, Fingerprint, Pattern, Language) instead of showing "claude" or "text_pattern".

## [0.1.257] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed
- **Ad marker reasons show bare sponsor names instead of descriptions**: Three independent bugs caused ad markers to display unhelpful reasons like "Ironclad" or "Contains" instead of descriptive text. (1) Cross-stage merge in `_merge_detection_results` never updated the `reason` field when merging overlapping ads from different detection stages -- now picks the longer (more descriptive) reason. (2) Window deduplication in `deduplicate_window_ads` replaced reason based solely on confidence -- now keeps the more descriptive reason regardless of which window had higher confidence. (3) Claude reason extraction preferred `extract_sponsor_name` (bare name) over Claude's raw `reason` field -- now falls back to Claude's reason when it is substantially more descriptive than the bare sponsor name.

## [0.1.256] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Silent-gap ad merge** (Phase 18): Consecutive ads separated by up to 30s of silence (no speech) are now merged into a single ad. Previously only ads within 5s were merged, leaving fragmented detections when an ad break contained a brief silence between sponsors. New `_has_speech_in_range()` method checks transcript segments to distinguish silent gaps from content. `MAX_SILENT_GAP` constant (30s) added to config.
- **Incremental search index updates** (Phase 19): New `index_episode()` method indexes a single episode immediately after processing, so it appears in search results without waiting for a full rebuild. Periodic full rebuild runs every 6 hours via `run_cleanup()`.
- **VTT-based transcript timestamps in UI** (Phase 20): EpisodeDetail now fetches and parses the actual VTT transcript file for accurate timestamps instead of approximating by evenly distributing text across the episode duration. Falls back to the old approximation when VTT is unavailable.
- **Processed transcript text storage** (Phase 20): New `generate_text()` method on TranscriptGenerator produces a `[HH:MM:SS.sss --> HH:MM:SS.sss] text` format stored in the database after processing. This is the ad-free, timestamp-adjusted transcript used by search indexing.

### Changed
- **Renamed to MinusPod** (Phase 22): Service name, Docker image, frontend title, package name, API docs title, README heading, and deployment docs all updated from "Podcast Server" / "podcast-server" to "MinusPod" / "minuspod".
- **Pass label text in UI** (Phase 20): Detection stage labels changed from "first pass" / "verification" to "pass 1" / "pass 2" for consistency.

### Fixed
- **Fingerprint scan wastes iterations when all fingerprints are broken** (Phase 17): When every known fingerprint in the database is corrupt, the sliding window loop still iterated through the entire audio file doing ffmpeg+fpcalc work for nothing. Added a bail-out check that breaks immediately when all known fingerprints are in the broken set.

### Removed
- **Dead code cleanup** (Phase 21): Removed three unused functions: `extract_url_sponsor()` from ad_detector.py, `extract_segments_with_timestamps()` from utils/text.py, `format_time_simple()` from utils/time.py.

## [0.1.255] - 2026-02-13

### Fixed
- **v0.1.254 fix missed ctypes.ArgumentError**: The corrupt fingerprint exception is `ctypes.ArgumentError` (from the C library binding), not Python's `TypeError`. The `<class 'TypeError'>` in the error message was the ctypes description of the type mismatch, not the exception class. Updated the catch to handle both `TypeError` and `ctypes.ArgumentError`.

## [0.1.254] - 2026-02-13

### Fixed
- **Stuck episode caused by corrupt audio fingerprint in database**: A corrupt fingerprint stored in the database caused `acoustid.chromaprint.decode_fingerprint()` to throw `TypeError` on every comparison. The `find_matches()` sliding window loop (3300 iterations for a 6605s episode) caught and swallowed the error each time, taking ~47 minutes of wasted work -- longer than the 37-minute orphan detector timeout. The episode was killed, reset, and retried in a loop it could never escape. Fix: `compare_fingerprints()` now returns -1.0 for TypeError (distinguishing broken data from no-match), and `find_matches()` tracks broken pattern IDs in a set, skipping them after the first failure. Corrupt fingerprints are auto-deleted from the database. A 47-minute scan of errors becomes 1 warning + fast completion.

## [0.1.253] - 2026-02-12

### Fixed
- **Pre-roll ads starting at 0.0s silently dropped**: The LLM response parser used Python `or`-chains to extract start/end timestamps from Claude's JSON response. Since `0.0` is falsy in Python, `0.0 or ad.get('start_time')` would skip the valid value and fall through to `None`, causing the ad to be silently discarded at the `start_val is not None` check. Replaced `or`-chains with `_first_not_none()` helper that correctly treats `0` and `0.0` as valid values. Every pre-roll ad starting at timestamp 0.0 was previously being lost.

## [0.1.252] - 2026-02-12

### Changed
- **Detection prompts updated to reduce false positives** (Phase 16): Removed "when in doubt, mark it as an ad" bias from Pass 1 prompt. Both Pass 1 and Pass 2 prompts now require identifiable promotional language (sponsor names, URLs, promo codes, product pitches, calls to action) to flag an ad. Added "WHAT IS NOT AN AD" section to Pass 1 listing silence/pauses, topic transitions, and audio-only anomalies. Added "AUDIO SIGNALS" section to Pass 1 explicitly stating signals are supporting evidence only. Added CRITICAL paragraph to Pass 2 requiring promotional transcript content. Removed "BE THOROUGH" over-flagging encouragement from Pass 2. Strengthened audio_enforcer.py header to reinforce that audio signals without promotional content are not ads. Addresses SN 1064 false positive where a 2935-2970s silence gap was flagged as an ad at 65% confidence.

## [0.1.251] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- **Pass 2 heuristic roll ads showing wrong timestamps in UI** (Phase 15.3): Pre/post-roll ads detected by heuristic on processed audio were copied directly into `verification_ads_original` with processed-audio timestamps. Since pass 1 cuts shift the timeline, these timestamps were wrong in the UI. Now maps heuristic roll ad timestamps through `_map_to_original` using the pass 1 cuts, matching how Claude's verification ads are already mapped.

## [0.1.250] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- **Heuristic pre/post-roll detection** (Phase 15): New `roll_detector.py` with regex-based detection for ads at episode boundaries that Claude missed due to LLM nondeterminism. Detects ad indicators (URLs, phone numbers, CTAs, promo codes) before show intro (pre-roll) and after sign-off (post-roll). Requires 2+ pattern matches with conservative confidence (0.80-0.95). Runs in both Pass 1 and Pass 2.

### Changed
- **Confidence slider is now the single source of truth** (Phase 11): AdValidator's `_make_decision` no longer has hardcoded 0.85/0.60 dual-thresholds that bypassed the user's min_cut_confidence slider. The ACCEPT/REVIEW boundary now uses the slider value (default 80%). Ads between REJECT_CONFIDENCE and the slider correctly get REVIEW instead of being silently auto-accepted. Removed `HIGH_CONFIDENCE` constant from config.py.
- **Pattern learning quality gates** (Phase 10): `_learn_from_detections` now only creates patterns from ads that were actually cut (`was_cut=True`). Sponsor extraction uses 4-tier DB resolution (DB lookup on sponsor field, DB lookup on reason text, regex extraction, raw sponsor fallback) with two rejection gates: prefix check (rejects "Capital" when "Capital One" exists in DB) and short-word check for unknown sponsors. Removed space-stripping from `_extract_sponsor_from_reason` that corrupted multi-word names.
- **Pattern learning moved from ad_detector to main.py**: `_learn_from_detections` call moved to after validation sets `was_cut`, so the `was_cut` gate works correctly.
- **Episode duration from audio file** (Phase 14): `episode_duration` now uses `audio_processor.get_audio_duration()` instead of `segments[-1]['end']`. Fixes trailing ads not being extended when audio file is longer than last transcribed word (Whisper stops at speech end, missing trailing silence/music/jingle).

### Fixed
- **Reason fallback logic** (Phase 9): `extract_sponsor_name()` is now tried first; only falls back to Claude's raw reason field if it returns the default "Advertisement detected". Previously the raw reason was checked first but rejected valid values like "mid-roll" or "host read" that appeared in `INVALID_SPONSOR_VALUES`.
- **Pass 2 ads displayed out of chronological order** (Phase 12): Combined ads list now sorted by start timestamp after appending pass 2 verification ads.
- **Pass 2 status showing "Verifying" instead of substages** (Phase 13): Changed verification detection callback from `verifying:N/M` to `detecting:N/M` so the UI shows "Pass 2: Detecting ads" instead of overwriting substage labels. Removed premature `pass2:verifying` status update. Cleaned up `pass2:verifying` label from frontend status bar.

## [0.1.249] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- **Pass 2 ads missing from UI**: `save_combined_ads` was called only with pass 1 ads. Pass 2 verification ads (`v_ads_for_ui`) were cut from audio but never appended to the stored ad markers, so they didn't appear in the UI or API response. Now re-saves combined ads after verification adds its ads.
- **Pass 2 status stuck on "Verifying"**: Verification pass only reported status during Claude detection (via progress callback), but transcription and audio analysis stages had no status updates. Added `progress_callback` calls for transcribing and analyzing steps inside `VerificationPass.verify()`, so the UI now shows "Pass 2: Transcribing", "Pass 2: Analyzing audio", "Pass 2: Detecting ads" progression.

## [0.1.248] - 2026-02-11

### Changed
- **Transition detection threshold raised from 3.5 dB to 12.0 dB**: The old threshold caught normal audio variation as DAI splices. Real DAI ad insertions produce 12+ dB jumps. Added delta-ratio symmetry filter (< 0.5 rejected) and recalibrated confidence formula.
- **Audio enforcer converted from independent actor to prompt formatter**: The old enforcer pattern-matched transcript text independently of Claude and created phantom ads. New `AudioEnforcer.format_for_window()` formats audio signals as text context injected into Claude's per-window prompts so Claude makes all ad/not-ad decisions with full audio evidence.
- **Audio signals now included in Claude's detection prompts**: Both pass 1 (`detect_ads`) and pass 2 (`run_verification_detection`) inject DAI transition pairs and volume anomalies into each window's prompt via the audio enforcer formatter.
- **Verification pass returns dual timestamps**: Pass 2 now maps processed-audio timestamps back to original-audio coordinates. `ads` (original timestamps) used for UI/DB display, `ads_processed` (processed timestamps) used for FFMPEG cutting. Fixes timestamp mismatch where pass 2 ads showed wrong positions in the UI.
- **Frontend status display shows pass 1/pass 2 stages**: Status bar labels prefixed with "Pass 1:" and "Pass 2:" for clarity. `getStageLabel()` function handles substage parsing (e.g., `pass1:detecting:2/5`). Detection stage badges renamed from "First Pass"/"Audio Enforced"/"Verification" to "Pass 1"/"Pass 2".

### Removed
- **Whisper model unload before audio analysis**: Audio analysis is CPU-only, so unloading the GPU model before it was unnecessary and wasted 10-15s on reload for the verification pass.
- **Audio enforcer post-detection step**: The independent enforcement step in main.py that created ads from uncovered audio signals has been removed. Audio signals now flow through Claude's prompt instead.
- **`DAI_CONFIDENCE_ONLY_THRESHOLD` config constant**: No longer needed since the enforcer no longer creates ads independently.

### Fixed
- **Verification pass `_transcribe_on_gpu` double exception handling**: The inner try/except caught all exceptions and returned `[]`, preventing the outer catch from ever setting `'transcription_failed'` status. Removed inner try/except so exceptions propagate to the caller.
- **Anthropic SDK pinned version**: Unpinned `anthropic==0.49.0` to `anthropic>=0.49.0` to allow compatible updates.

## [0.1.247] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- **Verification pass uses GPU instead of CPU**: Verification transcription was creating a fresh CPU model (20-30x slower) instead of reusing the GPU singleton. Now calls `WhisperModelSingleton.get_instance()` which lazy-reloads the GPU model after it was freed for audio analysis. ~30-min episodes go from 15-30 min to ~1-2 min for verification transcription.
- **ACCEPT decisions now always cut**: Validator ACCEPT (confidence >= 0.60) and the cutting filter (MIN_CUT_CONFIDENCE = 0.80) were contradictory -- ads with 0.60-0.79 confidence were ACCEPTed then not cut. Now ACCEPT = always cut, REJECT = never cut, REVIEW = confidence gate. This prevents validated ads like sponsor reads from being silently kept in audio.
- **AudioEnforcer false positives from confidence-only path**: DAI transition pairs with confidence >= 0.80 could create ads without any ad language in the transcript, causing false positives when strong audio transitions occurred during normal show content. Raised threshold from 0.80 to 0.95 (`DAI_CONFIDENCE_ONLY_THRESHOLD`). Ads with ad language in transcript are unaffected.
- **Mid-roll position boost gaps**: Position windows had dead zones (0.35-0.45, 0.55-0.65) where ads received no position boost. Simplified from three narrow windows (`MID_ROLL_1/2/3`) to a single continuous range (0.15-0.85) so all mid-roll ads get the +0.05 confidence boost.

## [0.1.246] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- **CTranslate2 cuDNN crash (SIGABRT code 134)**: The nvidia-cudnn-cu12 pip package installs `.so` files into Python's site-packages (`nvidia/cudnn/lib/`), but CTranslate2 uses `dlopen()` which only searches `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and system paths. Added `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to Dockerfile ENV pointing to the nvidia pip package lib directories. Removed redundant `nvidia-cudnn-cu12` from requirements.txt (already a dependency of torch).

## [0.1.245] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- **Restore nvidia-cudnn-cu12 dependency**: CTranslate2 (faster-whisper GPU backend) requires cuDNN for CUDA inference. Removal in v0.1.242 caused worker SIGABRT crashes during transcription. Re-added `nvidia-cudnn-cu12==8.9.2.26`.
- **Pattern backfill crash**: `extract_transcript_segment` was called in `database.py` but never imported. Replaced with already-imported `extract_text_in_range` (identical behavior).
- **Stuck episode reset killing active jobs**: `reset_stuck_processing_episodes()` ran on every Gunicorn worker boot and reset ALL processing episodes with no time check. A worker restart during active transcription would kill the in-progress job. Added 30-minute guard so only genuinely stuck episodes are reset.
- **Orphaned queue state blocking reprocessing**: When a worker crashes (SIGABRT), the flock is released by the OS but the state file still says "processing". `_clear_stale_state()` only checked the 60-minute timeout, so any reprocess attempt got "already_processing" for up to an hour. Now probes the flock to detect orphaned state immediately -- if no process holds the lock, the state is cleared regardless of elapsed time.

## [0.1.244] - 2026-02-10

### Changed
- **Detailed verification prompt**: Replaced simplified verification pass prompt with full version including fragment detection (highest priority), missed ad patterns, "how to identify fragments" guidance, ad boundary rules, and three concrete examples (fragment, missed ad, clean episode).
- **First pass prompt improvement**: Added "dynamically inserted ads" detection line to first pass prompt WHAT TO LOOK FOR section.

### Removed
- **Dead second pass prompt**: Removed unused `DEFAULT_SECOND_PASS_PROMPT` constant (blind second pass was replaced by verification pipeline in v0.1.242).
- **Stale UI text**: Removed "Can be skipped per-podcast" from verification pass Settings description (no longer applicable).

## [0.1.243] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- **Pin numpy<2.0 for CPU compatibility**: numpy 2.x requires X86_V2 CPU instructions which the target server lacks, causing a RuntimeError on startup via ctranslate2 import. Pinning numpy<2.0 resolves the crash introduced when the huggingface_hub upper pin was removed (pyannote constraint gone).

## [0.1.242] - 2026-02-10

### Changed
- **Replaced two-pass architecture with verification pipeline**: The blind second pass (re-analyzing the same transcript with a different prompt) is replaced by a post-cut verification pass that re-transcribes the processed audio on CPU and runs full detection with a "what doesn't belong" prompt. If missed ads are found, the pass 1 output is re-cut directly. No timestamp mapping needed since verification operates entirely in processed-audio coordinates.
- **Removed audio context injection from Claude's prompt**: Audio signals (volume anomalies, transitions) were previously formatted as text and injected into Claude's sliding window prompt. This indirect approach is replaced by programmatic audio enforcement (see below) that acts as a post-Claude step.
- **Removed speaker diarization and music bed detection**: Dropped pyannote.audio and librosa dependencies entirely. Speaker analysis and music detection added GPU memory pressure, processing time, and heavy dependencies (nvidia-cudnn-cu12, HF_TOKEN auth) for marginal benefit. Audio analysis now runs volume analysis only (ffmpeg ebur128, zero extra dependencies) plus the new transition detector.
- **Audio analysis always enabled**: Removed the global `audioAnalysisEnabled` toggle and per-feed `audioAnalysisOverride` settings. Volume analysis via ffmpeg is lightweight and always runs.
- **Settings renamed**: `secondPassPrompt` -> `verificationPrompt`, `secondPassModel` -> `verificationModel`. Old settings are automatically migrated. `multiPassEnabled` toggle removed (verification always runs).
- **AdMarker schema updated**: `pass` field (1, 2, "merged") replaced with `detection_stage` enum (`first_pass`, `audio_enforced`, `verification`).

### Added
- **Abrupt transition detection**: New `TransitionDetector` analyzes frame-to-frame loudness jumps in the existing volume analyzer output (zero extra cost). Pairs up/down transitions into candidate DAI (dynamically inserted ad) regions with configurable thresholds (`TRANSITION_THRESHOLD_DB`, `MIN/MAX_TRANSITION_AD_DURATION`).
- **Audio signal enforcement**: New `AudioEnforcer` runs after Claude's first pass to programmatically check whether audio signals overlap with detected ads. Uncovered DAI transition pairs with ad language in the transcript (or high confidence >= 0.8, or sponsor match) become new ads. Volume anomalies require both ad language AND sponsor match (higher bar). Existing ads are extended up to 30s when a signal partially overlaps their boundaries.
- **Verification pass module**: New `VerificationPass` class encapsulates the full post-cut pipeline: CPU re-transcription (using faster_whisper directly, not WhisperModelSingleton), audio analysis on processed audio, Claude detection with verification prompt/model, audio enforcement, and ad validation.
- **Separate verification model setting**: The verification pass can use a different Claude model from the first pass, configurable in Settings as "Verification Model".

### Removed
- **Dependencies**: `librosa>=0.10.0`, `pyannote.audio>=3.1.0,<4.0.0`, `nvidia-cudnn-cu12==8.9.2.26`. Removed `huggingface_hub` upper version pin (`<1.0` was a pyannote constraint).
- **Files**: `src/audio_analysis/speaker_analyzer.py`, `src/audio_analysis/music_detector.py`.
- **Methods**: `detect_ads_second_pass()`, `is_multi_pass_enabled()`, `get_second_pass_prompt()`, `get_second_pass_model()`, `_format_audio_context()`, `_format_time()`, `format_for_claude()`, `is_enabled_for_podcast()` from AudioAnalyzer.
- **Settings**: `multi_pass_enabled`, `audio_analysis_enabled`, `volume_analysis_enabled`, `music_detection_enabled`, `speaker_analysis_enabled`, `music_confidence_threshold`, `monologue_duration_threshold`.
- **Dataclasses**: `SpeakerSegment`, `ConversationMetrics`. `SignalType.MUSIC_BED`, `MONOLOGUE`, `SPEAKER_CHANGE` enum values.

---

## [0.1.241] - 2026-02-09

### Changed
- **Centralized shared constants into `utils/constants.py`**: Deduplicated `INVALID_SPONSOR_VALUES` (3 definitions across `ad_detector.py` and `text_pattern_matcher.py`), `STRUCTURAL_FIELDS`, `SPONSOR_PRIORITY_FIELDS`, `SPONSOR_PATTERN_KEYWORDS`, `INVALID_SPONSOR_CAPTURE_WORDS`, and `NOT_AD_CLASSIFICATIONS` into a single source of truth. All consumers now import from `utils.constants`.
- **Consolidated `extract_sponsor_from_text()` into `SponsorService`**: Removed 3 identical implementations (module-level in `api.py`, local function in `database.py`, and local function in `ad_detector.py`). `SponsorService.extract_sponsor_from_text()` is now the canonical static method; `api.py` delegates to it, `database.py` uses a lazy import.
- **Extracted `_parse_aliases()` helper in `SponsorService`**: Replaced 3 identical JSON alias-parsing blocks in `get_sponsor_names()`, `find_sponsor_in_text()`, and `get_sponsors_in_text()` with a single `_parse_aliases()` static method.
- **Precompiled sponsor regex patterns in `SponsorService`**: Word-boundary patterns for sponsor matching are now compiled once during `_refresh_cache_if_needed()` and stored as `_compiled_patterns` dict, instead of recompiling per search call.
- **Replaced `datetime.utcnow()` with `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`**: Updated all 19 call sites across 7 files (`cleanup_service.py`, `main.py`, `api.py`, `database.py`, `sponsor_service.py`, `pattern_service.py`, `text_pattern_matcher.py`). Removed `.replace(tzinfo=None)` workarounds that were needed for mixed tz-aware/naive comparisons. All timestamp strings stored to DB now use `strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')` to match SQLite's default format, replacing `.isoformat() + 'Z'` which would have produced malformed `+00:00Z` suffixes with tz-aware datetimes.
- **Replaced hardcoded thresholds with config constants**: Added `CONTENT_DURATION_THRESHOLD` (120s) and `LOW_EVIDENCE_WARN_THRESHOLD` (60s) to `config.py`. Updated `ad_detector.py` to use `LOW_CONFIDENCE`, `CONTENT_DURATION_THRESHOLD`, and `LOW_EVIDENCE_WARN_THRESHOLD` instead of hardcoded `0.5`, `120`, and `60`.
- **Eliminated redundant stale-state checks in `ProcessingQueue`**: `is_processing()` and `is_busy()` no longer call `_clear_stale_state()` directly since `get_current()` already does it.
- **Removed 4 redundant inline `import json` statements in `api.py`**: `json` is already imported at module level.

### Fixed
- **Atomic state file write in `ProcessingQueue`**: `_write_state()` now writes to a `.tmp` file and renames atomically, preventing corrupt state if the process crashes or OOMs mid-write.
- **Strategy 3 JSON parse unhandled exception**: `ad_detector.py` Strategy 3 (bracket fallback) `json.loads()` was not wrapped in try/except unlike Strategies 1-2. Now catches `json.JSONDecodeError` with diagnostic logging (content length, first/last chars).
- **5 bare `except:` clauses replaced with specific types**: `api.py` (json/type/key errors), `main.py` x2 (value/type errors), `transcriber.py` x2 (OS errors for file cleanup).

### Added
- **Updated OpenAPI spec from 0.1.184 to current**: Added 16 missing endpoint definitions (OPML import, batch reprocess, sponsor CRUD, normalization CRUD, pattern stats/health/merge, search endpoints, queue clear, prompts reset). Updated 3 existing sponsor/normalization endpoints to reflect the new SponsorService CRUD API. Added `Sponsor`, `Normalization`, and `SearchResult` schemas. Version is now served dynamically from `version.py` at runtime.
- **Wired up pattern learning pipeline**: 4 functions (260 lines) that were part of the designed pattern learning system but had zero callers are now connected:
  - `merge_similar_patterns()`: Called from `promote_pattern()` after promotion to consolidate similar patterns at the new scope level.
  - `check_sponsor_global_promotion()` and `auto_promote_sponsor_patterns()`: Called from `record_pattern_match()` when a sponsor hits the global threshold (3+ podcasts).
  - `store_fingerprint()`: Called from `_learn_from_detections()` after creating a text pattern, to also store the audio fingerprint for the same segment.

---

## [0.1.240] - 2026-02-08

### Fixed
- **Low-confidence segments without sponsor evidence accepted as ads**: Added a confidence gate (< 50%) before the existing duration gate in dynamic validation. Segments with no sponsor field, no known sponsor match, and no ad-language patterns are now rejected if confidence is below 50%, regardless of duration. Previously, short segments (< 120s) with confidence as low as 30-40% would pass through even when Claude's own reason described them as non-ads.
- **False positive sponsor matches from substring collision**: `find_sponsor_in_text()` and `get_sponsors_in_text()` used naive `in` substring matching, so short sponsor names or aliases (e.g., "cam") could match inside unrelated words (e.g., "Cam Newton"). Both functions now use `re.search()` with word boundaries (`\b`). Names and aliases shorter than 3 characters are skipped entirely to prevent false positives.
- **`was_cut=false` ads displayed alongside actually-removed ads in UI**: The API endpoint separated ad markers only by validator decision (REJECT vs everything else), so low-confidence REVIEW ads with `was_cut=false` appeared in `adMarkers` next to real removed ads. The separation logic now also checks `was_cut`: any ad with `was_cut=false` goes into `rejectedAdMarkers` regardless of validation decision.

---

## [0.1.239] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed
- **Content segments parsed as ads when LLM returns descriptive reasons without sponsor info**: Added dynamic ad-evidence validation in `_parse_ads_from_response()` that requires positive proof a segment is an ad (known sponsor in database, ad-language patterns, or explicit sponsor field) before accepting it. Segments >= 120s with no evidence are rejected; 60-120s segments log a warning. This replaces the whack-a-mole approach of growing blocklists with every new LLM output variation. The check is database-driven via `SponsorService.find_sponsor_in_text()` so new sponsors added via API automatically work without code changes.
- **Confidence values displayed as 10000% in UI**: When Claude returns confidence as a percentage (e.g., `100.0` instead of `1.0`), the parser now normalizes to 0-1 range by dividing values > 1.0 by 100, then clamping to [0.0, 1.0].

---

## [0.1.238] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed
- **Incorrect model IDs in fallback lists**: Fixed `claude-opus-4-1-20250414` to correct date suffix `claude-opus-4-1-20250805`. Removed `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` which is no longer in the Anthropic catalog. Added missing `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` (Haiku 4.5) and `claude-opus-4-20250514` (legacy Opus 4) to all three fallback lists: `AnthropicClient._get_fallback_models()`, `OpenAICompatibleClient._get_fallback_models()`, and `AdDetector.get_available_models()`. Also added `claude-opus-4-1-20250805` and `claude-opus-4-20250514` to the `ad_detector.py` fallback which was missing them entirely.

---

## [0.1.237] - 2026-02-07

### Added
- **Dynamic sponsor injection into Claude prompts**: `SponsorService.get_claude_sponsor_list()` existed but was never called. System and second-pass prompts now append a "DYNAMIC SPONSOR DATABASE" section at detection time with all known sponsors from the database. This supplements the hardcoded seed list without modifying the stored/customizable prompt text. Sponsors added via API or discovered during processing now actually influence future detections.
- **Podcast-specific sponsor history in detection context**: Both first and second pass now query `ad_patterns` for the podcast being processed and include "Previously detected sponsors for this podcast: X, Y, Z" in the description section. This gives Claude prior knowledge of which sponsors have appeared in this podcast before.
- **Configured models always shown in model list**: New `_ensure_configured_models_present()` ensures that models set as first-pass or second-pass model always appear in the `/settings/models` API response, even if the wrapper API doesn't advertise them. Logs when a configured model is injected.

### Fixed
- **Opus 4.6 missing from fallback model lists**: Added `claude-opus-4-6` to fallback lists in `AnthropicClient`, `OpenAICompatibleClient`, and `AdDetector.get_available_models()`. Fallbacks are used when the wrapper API is unreachable.

---

## [0.1.236] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed
- **Non-ads extracted as ads when Claude marks them `is_ad: false`**: Added filtering in `_parse_ads_from_response()` to skip entries where `is_ad` is explicitly false/no/0 or where `classification`/`type` indicates non-ad content (content, editorial, organic, interview, etc.). This was the root cause of episodes like `it-s-a-thing:1af1082d376d` losing over half their duration -- Claude's second pass returned segments with `is_ad: false` and `classification: "content"` but the parser treated ALL entries as ads regardless.
- **Generic "Advertisement detected" fallback from unknown field names**: Replaced static allowlists for sponsor and description extraction with dynamic field scanning. Instead of maintaining lists of field names Claude might use, the parser now defines STRUCTURAL_FIELDS (timestamps, booleans, config) and treats everything else as a candidate for sponsor/description info. This eliminates the recurring need to patch field names (previously patched in v0.1.217, 218, 220, 232, 234, 235).
- **Reason field duplication when sponsor and description overlap**: Added `_text_is_duplicate()` helper that checks if one string starts with the other or they share >80% of words. Prevents output like "BetterHelp advertisement: BetterHelp advertisement for therapy services".
- **Processing queue kills long-running jobs via stale lock detection**: `_clear_stale_state()` was called from `is_busy()`/`get_current()` without `_fd_lock` protection. When a long episode exceeded `MAX_JOB_DURATION`, stale detection would release the lock from under the running thread, allowing another episode to acquire it and causing concurrent processing failures. Now checks if the current process holds the lock before clearing -- if it does, the job is still alive (just long-running) and only a warning is logged.
- **Queue timeouts too aggressive for long episodes**: Increased `MAX_JOB_DURATION` from 30 to 60 minutes in both `processing_queue.py` and `status_service.py`. Increased `background_queue_processor()` max_wait from 10 to 60 minutes and orphan check threshold from 35 to 65 minutes.

## [0.1.235] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed
- **Ad detection reason parsing shows generic "Advertisement detected" instead of sponsor names**: Fixed parsing logic in `_parse_ads_from_response()` that was missing field names Claude uses. Added `sponsor_name` to `SPONSOR_PRIORITY_FIELDS` (Claude often returns this instead of just `sponsor`). Added `reason` and `notes` to description fields (Claude provides context in these). Added pre-check for valid `reason` field before running sponsor extraction - if Claude already provided a valid reason, use it directly instead of overwriting with extraction logic. This fixes the cascade where bad parsing led to no pattern creation (patterns are rejected when sponsor is "Advertisement detected").
- **Reason field duplicated in sponsor + description output**: When Claude provided a valid `reason` field (e.g., "BetterHelp advertisement for therapy"), the pre-check block correctly used it as the sponsor reason, but then the description extraction loop also matched the same `reason` field, producing duplicated output like "BetterHelp advertisement: BetterHelp advertisement". Removed `reason` from `desc_fields` since it is already handled by the pre-check block.
- **Crash on `end_text: null` from Claude response**: When Claude returns `"end_text": null` in JSON, `dict.get('end_text', '')` returns `None` (not `""`) because the key exists with an explicit null value. This caused `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable` when slicing for log output. Fixed all three `end_text` access points to use `or ''` pattern which correctly converts None to empty string.

---

## [0.1.234] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed
- **Ad detection parsing missing ads_detected key and nested structures**: Fixed bug in `_parse_ads_from_response()` where Claude's ad detections were not being extracted due to missing parser support. Added support for `ads_detected` key (Claude sometimes uses this instead of `ads`). Added support for nested `window` structure (e.g., `{"window": {"ads_detected": [...]}}`). The `parse_timestamp()` function already handles string timestamps with "s" suffix (e.g., "28.8s"). This fixes episodes where Claude correctly detected ads but the parser failed to extract them.

---

## [0.1.233] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed
- **Reprocess button does nothing when queue is busy**: When clicking "Reprocess" while another episode was processing, the API returned "queued" but never actually added the episode to the processing queue. The `background_queue_processor()` only reads from the `auto_process_queue` table, so episodes that bypassed this table were never picked up. Both reprocess endpoints (`/reprocess` and `/episodes/{id}/reprocess`) now call `db.queue_episode_for_processing()` when the processing lock is busy, ensuring episodes are actually added to the queue for background processing.

---

## [0.1.232] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed
- **Ad detection parsing failures**: Fixed bug in `_parse_ads_from_response()` where valid ads were not being extracted from Claude's responses. Added support for `ads_and_sponsorships` response key (Claude sometimes uses this instead of just `ads`). Added support for `start_timestamp`/`end_timestamp` field names (Claude's alternate naming convention). This fixes 0 ads detected for episodes where Claude was correctly identifying ads but the parser couldn't extract them.
- **CUDA OOM from legacy reprocess endpoint**: The old `/feeds/<slug>/episodes/<episode_id>/reprocess` endpoint was calling `process_episode()` directly, bypassing the `ProcessingQueue` lock that prevents concurrent GPU processing. This allowed two episodes to transcribe simultaneously, exhausting GPU memory. Updated to use `start_background_processing()` like the new endpoint, ensuring proper queue coordination. The endpoint now returns 202 Accepted and processes asynchronously.

---

## [0.1.231] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed
- **Infinite episode retry loop**: Fixed bug introduced in v0.1.225 where `reset_orphaned_queue_items()` would reset stuck queue items to 'pending' indefinitely without incrementing the `attempts` counter. Episodes that repeatedly fail (e.g., CUDA OOM on long episodes) would cycle forever: fail -> reset to pending -> retry -> fail -> repeat. Now the function increments `attempts` on each reset and marks items as permanently 'failed' after exceeding `max_attempts` (default 3). This stops resource-consuming episodes from blocking the queue indefinitely.

---

## [0.1.230] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed
- **Concurrent episode processing despite fcntl.flock**: Fixed bug where two episodes could still process simultaneously within the same Gunicorn worker. The issue was that `acquire()` always opened a new file descriptor, overwriting `_lock_fd` and orphaning the previous fd. Since `flock()` is per-fd (not per-file) within the same process, the second `flock()` on a different fd would succeed. Added `_fd_lock` threading lock to synchronize access to `_lock_fd` across threads, and added early rejection if `_lock_fd` is already set (meaning this process already holds the lock). Promoted lock acquire/release logging from DEBUG to INFO for production visibility.

---

## [0.1.229] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed
- **Concurrent episode processing causing CUDA OOM**: ProcessingQueue was using `threading.Lock` which only prevents concurrent access within a single Python process. With 2 Gunicorn workers (separate processes), each had its own lock, allowing both to process episodes simultaneously and exhausting GPU memory. Replaced with `fcntl.flock()` file-based locking that coordinates across all worker processes. The lock file and state are stored in `/app/data/` for cross-process visibility.

- **Episode ID instability causing duplicates**: Same episodes were appearing multiple times in the database with different IDs because some RSS feeds (especially Megaphone) have unstable GUIDs or dynamic URL parameters. Added title+pubDate deduplication check in `refresh_rss_feed()` - before queuing a "new" episode, we now check if an episode with the same title and publish date already exists. If found, the episode is skipped with a warning log. Added `get_episode_by_title_and_date()` method to database.py.

---

## [0.1.228] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed
- **App startup failure**: Added migration to update episodes table CHECK constraint to include `permanently_failed` status. The `permanently_failed` status was added in v0.1.225 code but the migration to update existing databases' CHECK constraint was missing. SQLite requires table recreation to modify constraints.

---

## [0.1.227] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed
- **SQLite database locking**: Fixed "database is locked" errors that occurred during concurrent database access (e.g., when transcription completed while another operation was writing). Added `PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL` for Write-Ahead Logging (allows concurrent readers with one writer) and `PRAGMA busy_timeout = 30000` (SQLite retries for 30 seconds instead of failing immediately). The existing `timeout=30.0` in `sqlite3.connect()` is Python's lock acquisition timeout, not SQLite's busy timeout - SQLite's default busy_timeout is 0 which fails immediately on lock contention.

---

## [0.1.226] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed
- **Duplicate episode ID generation**: Fixed bug where the same episode would be processed repeatedly with different IDs. The issue occurred because `generate_episode_id()` used only the audio URL, which can include dynamic CDN tracking parameters (e.g., Megaphone's `awCollectionId`/`awEpisodeId`). When these parameters changed between RSS refreshes, the same episode appeared as "new" with a different ID, causing infinite reprocessing loops. Now uses RSS GUID (stable identifier per RSS spec) with URL fallback for feeds without GUIDs.

- **Dead code cleanup**: Removed two calls to non-existent `storage.delete_ads_json()` method in reprocess endpoints. The method was removed in v0.1.26 but calls remained wrapped in try/except, causing harmless warnings. Data clearing is already handled by `db.clear_episode_details()`.

- **Queue race condition**: Moved `status_service.start_job()` call from inside the processing thread to immediately after acquiring the ProcessingQueue lock in `start_background_processing()`. This prevents a new episode from starting before StatusService knows about the current one, closing a timing gap that allowed episode overlap.

- **Ad detection progress updates**: Added `progress_callback` parameter to `detect_ads()`, `detect_ads_second_pass()`, and `process_transcript()` methods. Now reports progress for each detection window (e.g., "detecting:3/12"), keeping the UI progress indicator alive during the 2-5+ minute ad detection phase that previously caused the progress bar to disappear.

---

## [0.1.225] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed
- **Sponsor extraction garbage capture**: Fixed regex patterns in `extract_sponsor_from_text()` that would incorrectly extract common English words as sponsor names (e.g., "not an" from "This is not an advertisement", "consistent with" from Claude reasoning). Added `INVALID_SPONSOR_CAPTURE_WORDS` validation and rejection of all-lowercase multi-word phrases.

- **Queue race condition**: Fixed race condition where `db.update_queue_status(queue_id, 'processing')` was called BEFORE the processing lock was acquired. If the worker crashed between these calls, the queue item would remain stuck in 'processing' status. Now the status is only updated AFTER successfully acquiring the lock.

- **Stuck episode retry tracking**: Enhanced `reset_stuck_processing_episodes()` to track retry count and mark episodes as `permanently_failed` after 3 crashes (MAX_EPISODE_RETRIES). Prevents infinite retry loops for episodes that consistently crash workers (e.g., OOM issues).

### Added
- **Orphaned queue detection**: Added `db.reset_orphaned_queue_items()` method to detect and reset queue items stuck in 'processing' for over 35 minutes. Called periodically from the queue processor to recover from worker crashes without restart.

- **Confidence threshold logging**: Added log line at start of episode processing showing current confidence threshold (e.g., "Confidence threshold: 80%"). Helps verify the aggressiveness slider setting is being applied.

- **Podcast description in prompts**: Now passes the podcast-level description (in addition to episode description) to Claude prompts for both first and second pass ad detection. This provides additional context about the show format and typical sponsors.

### Improved
- **JSON format instructions**: Enhanced JSON output instructions for Anthropic API to be more explicit: numbered requirements, explicit "use null not None" rule, clearer formatting. Reduces JSON parse errors from malformed responses.

- **Podcast description in UI**: Added missing `description` field to `/feeds/{slug}` API response. The UI already supported displaying podcast descriptions but the API wasn't returning it.

---

## [0.1.224] - 2026-02-02

### Fixed
- **Reprocess endpoint timeout**: Fixed 504 Gateway Timeout when reprocessing episodes. The endpoint was calling `process_episode()` synchronously, causing nginx to timeout before processing completed. Now uses `start_background_processing()` (same pattern as JIT processing) and returns 202 Accepted immediately. The frontend polls for status updates via existing mechanisms.

---

## [0.1.223] - 2026-02-02

### Fixed
- **Full Analysis mode now actually processes**: Fixed backend bug where the `/episodes/{slug}/{episodeId}/reprocess` endpoint only set `status='pending'` in the database but never triggered actual processing. Episodes would remain stuck in pending status indefinitely. The endpoint now clears cached data and calls `process_episode()` synchronously, matching the behavior of the legacy reprocess endpoint.

---

## [0.1.222] - 2026-02-02

### Added
- **Pattern ID column on Patterns page**: Added sortable ID column as the first column in the patterns table. Pattern IDs are now visible in both desktop table view and mobile card view.

- **Clickable pattern links in ad reasons**: Pattern references like "(pattern #63)" in detected ad descriptions are now clickable links that navigate to the pattern detail modal on the Patterns page.

- **Pattern search by ID**: The search filter on the Patterns page now also matches pattern IDs, so you can search for "63" to find pattern #63.

### Fixed
- **"Full Analysis" mode ignored during reprocess**: Fixed a bug where clicking "Full Analysis" in the reprocess menu would still use patterns instead of pure Claude analysis. The frontend was calling the wrong API endpoint (`/feeds/{slug}/episodes/{episodeId}/reprocess`) which ignored the mode parameter. Now correctly calls `/episodes/{slug}/{episodeId}/reprocess` which properly handles the mode.

---

## [0.1.221] - 2026-02-02

### Improved
- **Pattern match descriptions include pattern reference**: Pattern-matched ads now show "Sponsor (pattern #X)" format in the reason field instead of just the sponsor name. This provides traceability for pattern matches, making it easier to identify and manage patterns.

### Added
- **GET /patterns/contaminated endpoint**: New endpoint to find all active patterns containing multiple ad transition phrases, indicating merged multi-sponsor ads that should be split. Returns pattern IDs, sponsors, text lengths, and transition counts.

- **POST /patterns/{id}/split endpoint**: New endpoint to split a contaminated pattern into separate single-sponsor patterns. Uses the existing `TextPatternMatcher.split_pattern()` method to detect ad transitions and create individual patterns. The original pattern is disabled after successful split.

---

## [0.1.220] - 2026-02-01

### Fixed
- **Multi-sponsor pattern contamination**: Added `detect_multi_sponsor_pattern()` and `split_pattern()` methods to `TextPatternMatcher` to detect and split patterns that were incorrectly created with multiple sponsor reads merged together. These methods scan for common ad transition phrases ("this episode is brought to you by", "brought to you by", etc.) and create separate patterns for each sponsor.

- **Prevention of future contamination**: Added validation to `create_pattern_from_ad()` to reject patterns with:
  - Duration > 120 seconds (reduced from 180s) - single ads rarely exceed 2 minutes
  - Multiple ad transition phrases detected - indicates merged multi-ad spans
  - Sponsor name not appearing in intro text - may indicate misattribution

- **Missing descriptions in reason field**: Enhanced `_parse_ads_from_response()` to extract Claude's explanation/description from response and combine with sponsor name in the reason field. Now checks `explanation`, `content_summary`, `description`, `ad_description`, `message`, `content`, and `summary` fields. Descriptions over 150 characters are truncated.

---

## [0.1.219] - 2026-02-01

### Changed
- **Codebase cleanup**: Comprehensive cleanup to remove dead code, unused dependencies, and stale artifacts:
  - Deleted stale `tmp/` directory (docker-compose.wrapper.yml, llm_client.py copy, migration docs)
  - Removed unused `soundfile` dependency from requirements.txt
  - Removed unused imports from 9 Python files (ad_detector, chapters_generator, rss_parser, storage, text_pattern_matcher, transcriber, gpu, pattern_service, api)
  - Removed unused exception imports (APIError, APIConnectionError, RateLimitError, InternalServerError) from ad_detector.py
  - Fixed .gitignore duplicates (.env, *.db, *.log, pixelprobe.db) and removed contradictory CLAUDE.md entry
  - Removed TODO comment from main.py
  - Removed PLACEHOLDER env var from docker-compose.yml claude-wrapper service

---

## [0.1.218] - 2026-02-01

### Fixed
- **Reasoning field precedence bug in sponsor extraction**: Removed `reasoning` from `SPONSOR_PRIORITY_FIELDS` as it was incorrectly taking precedence over `sponsor_name` in Phase 2 pattern matching. The `reasoning` field contains descriptive text (e.g., "Host read ad for eBay promoting...") and was being returned instead of the actual sponsor name. Now `reasoning` is only used in Phase 4 for regex-based text extraction as a fallback when no direct sponsor name is found.

---

## [0.1.217] - 2026-02-01

### Improved
- **Enhanced sponsor name extraction from OpenAI wrapper responses**: Added Phase 4 text extraction to extract sponsor names from descriptive fields like `reasoning` and `summary` when direct fields are missing or invalid. Improvements include:
  - Added `reasoning` to priority fields (catches "This is a BetterHelp ad" style responses) [Note: reverted in v0.1.218]
  - Added `ad_name` and `note` to pattern keywords for fuzzy matching
  - Added `summary` to fallback fields
  - New regex-based extraction parses sponsor names from text like "X advertisement", "ad for X", "promoting X"
  - Reduces generic "Advertisement detected" labels when Claude provides sponsor info in descriptive fields

---

## [0.1.216] - 2026-02-01

### Fixed
- **XML entity encoding in RSS feeds**: Escape all text content and URLs when generating modified RSS feeds to prevent invalid XML from unescaped ampersands in URLs. Applies `_escape_xml()` to channel title, link, language, image fields, and item link, guid, pubDate fields. Fixes potential XML parsing errors in podcast apps when feed URLs contain tracking parameters with `&` characters.

---

## [0.1.215] - 2026-02-01

### Changed
- **Refactored advertiser field extraction**: Replaced the hardcoded 16-field fallback chain with a flexible three-phase approach:
  1. Priority fields checked in order: `reason`, `advertiser`, `sponsor`, `brand`, `company`, `product`, `name`
  2. Pattern matching scans all keys for substrings: `sponsor`, `brand`, `advertiser`, `company`, `product` (catches variants like `ad_sponsor`, `sponsor_name`, `detected_brand`)
  3. Fallback fields: `description`, `content_summary`, `ad_content`, `category`
- This eliminates the need to manually add new field names whenever Claude uses a variation

---

## [0.1.214] - 2026-02-01

### Fixed
- **Added `detected_brand` to fallback chain**: Claude sometimes uses `detected_brand` as the field name for advertiser. Added to the fallback chain to extract sponsor names from this field.

---

## [0.1.213] - 2026-02-01

### Fixed
- **Filter invalid sponsor values**: Added validation to filter out literal string values like "None", "unknown", "null", "n/a" that Claude sometimes returns as sponsor names. These invalid values are now properly skipped in the fallback chain, allowing the next valid field to be used or falling back to "Advertisement detected" instead of displaying unhelpful values.

---

## [0.1.212] - 2026-02-01

### Fixed
- **Expanded advertiser field fallback chain**: Added `ad_sponsor`, `sponsor_name`, and `sponsor_or_product` to the fallback chain for extracting advertiser names. These field names were discovered via enhanced logging when Claude uses alternate response structures. Fixes more cases where ads showed as generic "Advertisement detected" instead of actual advertiser names like "Stash", "Ethos", "Mint Mobile".

---

## [0.1.211] - 2026-01-31

### Changed
- **Enhanced ad extraction logging**: Promoted ad extraction logging from DEBUG to INFO level for production visibility. When ads are extracted from LLM responses, logs now show the timestamps, reason/advertiser, and available fields - helping diagnose when ad names show as generic "Advertisement detected" instead of actual advertiser names.

### Fixed
- **Added `category` to advertiser field fallback**: Some Claude responses use `category` as the advertiser/reason field. Added to the fallback chain to extract more descriptive ad names.

---

## [0.1.210] - 2026-01-31

### Fixed
- **Display advertiser names in pattern-matched ads**: Text pattern and fingerprint matches now use the sponsor name from the database pattern as the `reason` field instead of generic labels like "Text pattern match (outro, pattern 69)". Falls back to generic label if no sponsor is defined for the pattern.

---

## [0.1.209] - 2026-01-31

### Fixed
- **Expanded advertiser name extraction**: Added more field name patterns for extracting advertiser/sponsor names from Claude responses: `sponsor`, `brand`, `company`, `name`, `description`, `ad_content`. Fixes ads showing as generic "Advertisement detected" instead of the actual advertiser name.
- **Debug logging for ad extraction**: Added debug logging to show extracted ad details and available fields, helping diagnose future field name issues.

---

## [0.1.208] - 2026-01-31

### Fixed
- **Handle Claude's elaborate response structures**: Claude sometimes ignores the prompt's output format and returns elaborate structured objects with `segments` or `advertisement_segments` keys instead of `ads`. Updated Strategy 0 in `_parse_ads_from_response()` to extract ads from these alternate structures, filtering `segments` arrays to only include items with `type: "advertisement"`.
- **Handle alternate field names in ad validation**: Claude uses inconsistent field names (`start_time` vs `start`, `advertiser` vs `reason`, etc.). Updated validation loop to check multiple field name patterns: `start`/`start_time`/`ad_start_timestamp`/`start_time_seconds` for timestamps, and `reason`/`advertiser`/`product`/`content_summary` for descriptions.
- **v0.1.207 regression**: Fixed regression where objects with `segments` key containing ads were treated as "no ads found" because they lacked an explicit `ads` key.

---

## [0.1.207] - 2026-01-31

### Fixed
- **JSON object without 'ads' key**: When Claude returns a valid JSON object but without an "ads" key (e.g., `{"status": "no_ads_detected"}`), treat it as "no ads found" rather than falling through to legacy parsing strategies that could fail with "Extra data" errors.

---

## [0.1.206] - 2026-01-31

### Fixed
- **JSON object response parsing**: Claude in JSON mode sometimes returns `{"ads": [...]}` objects instead of raw arrays. Added Strategy 0 to `_parse_ads_from_response()` that extracts arrays from objects with "ads" key.
- **Timestamp format parsing**: Added `parse_timestamp()` helper that handles multiple formats: seconds (1178.5), MM:SS ("19:38"), HH:MM:SS ("1:19:38"), and strings with "s" suffix ("1178.5s"). Fixes "could not convert string to float" errors when Claude returns human-readable timestamps.

---

## [0.1.205] - 2026-01-31

### Fixed
- **JSON response format for OpenAI-compatible LLM backends**: Added `response_format` parameter to `LLMClient.messages_create()` interface and pass `{"type": "json_object"}` for ad detection calls. This triggers JSON mode in the Claude Code OpenAI wrapper, ensuring clean JSON responses instead of markdown-wrapped output that caused "No valid JSON array found in response" warnings.

---

## [0.1.203] - 2026-01-30

### Added
- **Optional OpenAI-compatible LLM support**: New abstraction layer (`llm_client.py`) allows using alternative LLM backends instead of direct Anthropic API. Supports:
  - Direct Anthropic API (default, uses API credits)
  - OpenAI-compatible APIs (Claude Code wrapper for Max subscription, Ollama, etc.)
- **LLM provider configuration**: New environment variables `LLM_PROVIDER`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_MODEL` for configuring alternative backends
- **Docker Compose wrapper service**: Optional `claude-wrapper` service for running the Claude Code OpenAI wrapper (enable with `--profile wrapper`)

### Changed
- **Ad detector refactored for LLM abstraction**: `ad_detector.py` now uses `llm_client.py` for all LLM interactions, maintaining backward compatibility
- **Chapters generator refactored for LLM abstraction**: `chapters_generator.py` now uses `llm_client.py` for all LLM interactions
- **Updated requirements**: Added `openai>=1.0.0` dependency for OpenAI-compatible API support

---

## [0.1.202] - 2026-01-29

### Fixed
- **Incorrect Whisper VRAM profiles causing overly conservative chunking**: Updated `WHISPER_MEMORY_PROFILES` in `config.py` to match faster-whisper's actual VRAM requirements (from README). large-v3 now correctly uses 5.5GB base (was 10GB), medium uses 4GB (was 5GB), small uses 2GB (was 2.5GB). This allows larger chunk sizes and fewer chunks for long episodes.
- **System RAM incorrectly limiting GPU transcription**: Changed `get_available_memory_gb()` in `utils/gpu.py` to use GPU VRAM as the primary limit for CUDA devices, not `min(GPU, System)`. System RAM was incorrectly limiting chunk sizes when GPU VRAM was the only relevant constraint.
- **API showing incorrect VRAM requirements**: Updated `/settings/whisper-models` endpoint to show correct values: medium now shows "~4GB", large-v3 shows "~5-6GB".

### Added
- **GPU memory logging after model load**: Added INFO-level log showing actual GPU memory allocated and reserved after Whisper model initialization, helping verify correct VRAM usage.
- **Memory visibility logging**: `get_available_memory_gb()` now logs both GPU and System RAM values at INFO level when running on CUDA, providing visibility into memory decisions.

---

## [0.1.201] - 2026-01-29

### Fixed
- **Uptime not resetting on container restart**: The `_get_start_time()` function in `api.py` was returning the stale value from the status file without calling `set_server_start_time()`. Renamed to `_init_server_start_time()` and now always writes the current time on module load, ensuring uptime resets on every server restart.

---

## [0.1.200] - 2026-01-29

### Added
- **Dynamic memory-aware chunked transcription**: Long episodes are now transcribed in dynamically-sized chunks based on available system RAM and GPU VRAM. The system:
  1. Queries available memory before each episode using `/proc/meminfo` and `torch.cuda`
  2. Uses model-specific memory profiles (base memory + MB/minute coefficients for each Whisper model size)
  3. Calculates optimal chunk duration with 70% safety margin
  4. Catches OOM errors during transcription and automatically retries with smaller chunks (halving up to 3 times)
  - Chunk sizes range from 5-60 minutes, with 30-second overlap for boundary alignment
  - Configurable via `CHUNK_*` and `WHISPER_MEMORY_PROFILES` in `config.py`
- **Memory cleanup on all failure paths**: Both `transcriber.py` and `main.py` now clear GPU memory and unload the Whisper model when transcription fails for any reason, preventing memory leaks during retry cycles.
- **Memory utility functions**: New `get_available_system_memory_gb()`, `get_available_gpu_memory_gb()`, and `get_available_memory_gb()` in `utils/gpu.py` for runtime memory detection.

### Fixed
- **OOM retry loops causing repeated failures**: OOM errors are now classified as permanent (non-transient) in `is_transient_error()`, preventing the 3x3=9 retry attempts that were causing the same episodes to fail repeatedly. OOM episodes are now immediately marked as `permanently_failed` instead of retrying at the episode level (chunk-level retries still occur with smaller chunks).

---

## [0.1.199] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed
- **Uptime persists across deploys**: The `server_start_time` in the shared status file was never overwritten on container restart because `set_server_start_time()` only wrote if no value existed. Now always overwrites, ensuring uptime resets on deploy.

---

## [0.1.198] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed
- **ProcessingQueue staleness causing permanent queue_busy**: When a worker is SIGKILL'd (OOM), StatusService correctly auto-clears stale jobs after 30 minutes, but ProcessingQueue (in-memory, per-worker) retained stale `_current_episode` state forever. Added timestamp tracking and staleness detection to ProcessingQueue, matching StatusService behavior. Also added cross-check with StatusService as truth source - if StatusService says no job is running but ProcessingQueue thinks one is, ProcessingQueue clears its state.

---

## [0.1.197] - 2026-01-27

### Fixed
- **Text pattern matching completely broken**: Fixed numpy/scipy sparse matrix boolean evaluation error (`not self._pattern_vectors`) that caused "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" on every processed episode since patterns were loaded. Changed to `self._pattern_vectors is None`. This was blocking ALL text pattern matching.
- **Settings page uptime flicker**: Different gunicorn workers had different `_start_time` values because each imports `api.py` independently. Server start time is now stored in shared `processing_status.json` so all workers report consistent uptime.
- **Stale processing/queue state after worker SIGKILL**: Added staleness detection to `StatusService._read_status_file()`. Jobs running longer than 30 minutes are auto-cleared; queue entries older than 1 hour are removed. This prevents permanently stuck status after OOM kills.
- **Chapter duration inconsistency**: Added `_enforce_min_duration()` to chapters generator that enforces the 3-minute minimum across all chapter sources (description timestamps, ad gaps, AI topic splits). Previously only ad-gap chapters had minimum duration enforcement.

### Added
- **Content-based ad boundary extension**: New `extend_ad_boundaries_by_content()` in ad detection pipeline checks transcript segments immediately before/after each detected ad for sponsor names, URLs, and promotional language. Extends boundaries to capture the full ad when detection cuts off ~5 seconds early (common with DAI ads). Configurable via `config.py` constants.
- **Created date column on Patterns page**: Added sortable "Created" column to the patterns table and changed default sort to newest-first (`created_at DESC`).

---

## [0.1.196] - 2026-01-20

### Fixed
- **Text pattern matching ineffective due to contaminated patterns**: Patterns were being created from merged multi-ad spans (3-8K+ chars) that could never match the 1500-char TF-IDF window. Added validation to reject patterns with duration >180s or text >3500 chars.
- **Auto-learning creating patterns from merged ads**: Adjacent ads within 3 seconds were merged before pattern learning, contaminating patterns with multiple ads. Added higher confidence threshold (0.92) for ads >90 seconds to prevent learning from merged spans.
- **Database lock race condition on startup**: Multiple gunicorn workers initializing simultaneously caused "database is locked" errors. Added retry logic with exponential backoff (5 attempts, 0.5s-8s delays) to handle concurrent schema initialization.

### Added
- **Pattern health check API** (`/api/v1/patterns/health`): New endpoint to identify oversized/contaminated patterns with severity levels (warning >2500 chars, critical >3500 chars) and recommendations
- **Enhanced pattern matching debug logging**: Lower threshold (0.4) for debug logging with pattern length vs window length comparison to help diagnose why patterns fail to match

### Changed
- **Database migration cleans contaminated patterns**: One-time migration deletes patterns with text_template >3500 chars on startup, removing patterns that were polluting the database and could never match

---

## [0.1.195] - 2026-01-20

### Fixed
- **Pattern detail page missing podcast info**: Fixed join condition in `get_ad_patterns()` which was incorrectly comparing slug against cast numeric ID. Also updated `get_ad_pattern_by_id()` to include the same join so individual pattern lookups return `podcast_name` and `podcast_slug`
- **Auto-learned patterns missing episode ID**: `create_pattern_from_ad()` and `_learn_from_detections()` now accept and pass through `episode_id` so auto-learned patterns have `created_from_episode_id` populated

### Changed
- **Pattern detail modal shows podcast link**: Podcast-scoped patterns now show the podcast slug as a clickable link to the podcast's episode list
- **Renamed "Created from" to "Origin Episode"**: Clearer label in pattern detail modal

---

## [0.1.194] - 2026-01-20

### Fixed
- **Podcast-scoped text patterns not matching**: Fixed three related bugs preventing podcast-scoped patterns from working:
  1. `podcast_id` was never passed to `process_transcript()`, so pattern matching always received `None` and filtered out all podcast-scoped patterns
  2. Auto-created patterns stored numeric database IDs instead of slug strings
  3. Added database migration to convert existing numeric podcast_ids to slugs for consistency

---

## [0.1.193] - 2026-01-19

### Fixed
- **Auto pattern learning not working**: Claude-detected ads did not include a `sponsor` field, causing `_learn_from_detections()` to skip all Claude ads. Added `_extract_sponsor_from_reason()` helper that uses `SponsorService` to look up sponsor names from the `known_sponsors` database table (e.g., "ZipRecruiter host-read sponsor segment" -> "ziprecruiter") so patterns can be created automatically.

---

## [0.1.192] - 2026-01-18

### Fixed
- **Slider invisible in dark mode**: Changed slider track background from `bg-secondary` to `bg-muted` so the ad detection aggressiveness slider is visible in dark mode

---

## [0.1.191] - 2026-01-18

### Fixed
- **Off-by-one error in text pattern matching**: Fixed asymmetric boundary comparison in `_char_pos_to_time()` that caused incorrect timestamp mapping for pattern matches at segment boundaries
- **Timestamp calculation in phrase finding**: Fixed character-to-word index mapping in `find_phrase_in_words()` which was breaking at the wrong word and failing for last-word matches
- **Race condition in ad merging**: Extracted sponsor mismatch extension into separate `_extend_ads_for_sponsor_mismatch()` function to prevent mutation during iteration
- **Temp file leak in audio preprocessing**: Added `finally` block cleanup in `preprocess_audio()` to prevent orphaned temp files on error paths
- **Division by zero in ad validation**: Added MIN_DURATION_THRESHOLD constant (1ms) to protect against edge cases in duration calculations
- **Pattern scope filtering not working**: Fixed `_filter_patterns_by_scope()` to actually compare podcast_id and network_id instead of just checking scope string
- **TF-IDF vocabulary mismatch**: Added BASE_AD_VOCABULARY with common podcast ad terms to prevent sklearn vectorizer from ignoring unseen terms in new text

### Added
- **Shared utilities module** (`src/utils/`): Consolidated duplicate functions across codebase
  - `utils/audio.py`: `get_audio_duration()` with ffprobe stderr logging, `AudioMetadata` caching class
  - `utils/time.py`: `parse_timestamp()`, `format_time()`
  - `utils/text.py`: `extract_text_in_range()`, `extract_text_from_segments()`
  - `utils/gpu.py`: `clear_gpu_memory()`, `get_gpu_memory_info()`
- **Automatic pattern learning**: High-confidence Claude detections (>=85%) now automatically create podcast-scoped patterns via `_learn_from_detections()`
- **Pattern match recording**: Pattern matches are now recorded for promotion metrics via `record_pattern_match()`
- **Centralized configuration constants**: Added TFIDF_MATCH_THRESHOLD, FUZZY_MATCH_THRESHOLD, FINGERPRINT_MATCH_THRESHOLD, subprocess timeouts to config.py

### Changed
- **Increased sliding window size**: Pattern matching window increased from 500 to 1500 characters (~60 seconds of speech) with 500 character step for better coverage of longer ads
- **Consolidated duplicate code**: Removed 6 copies of `get_audio_duration()`, 6 copies of `parse_timestamp()`, 5 copies of transcript extraction, 3 copies of GPU cleanup

---

## [0.1.190] - 2026-01-18

### Fixed
- **Music analysis timeout on long episodes**: Episodes over 1.5 hours now use "fast mode" that analyzes every 3rd frame and skips expensive HPSS (Harmonic-Percussive Source Separation) computation. This prevents the 805s+ timeouts that were occurring on 2+ hour episodes like Security Now.
- **Non-English DAI ads not detected**: Changed Whisper from `language="en"` to `language=None` for auto-detection. Non-English segments (especially Spanish ads) are now automatically flagged and treated as ads.
- **VAD filter too aggressive**: Adjusted VAD parameters to be more sensitive (`min_silence_duration_ms`: 500->1000, `speech_pad_ms`: 400->600, `threshold`: 0.3). This helps capture music-heavy ad segments that were being skipped.
- **End-of-episode ads not fully trimmed**: Ads that end within 30 seconds of the episode end are now extended to the actual end, eliminating leftover ad snippets at the end.

### Added
- **Ad detection aggressiveness slider**: New setting to control how confident the system must be before removing an ad. Lower values (50%) are more aggressive and remove more potential ads, while higher values (95%) are more conservative. Accessible via Settings page slider.
- Foreign language detection in transcription pipeline with `is_foreign_language` and `detected_language` segment attributes
- `_detect_foreign_language_ads()` method in ad detector that auto-detects non-English segments as DAI ads with 95% confidence
- Fast mode music detection: `_compute_music_probability_fast()` using only spectral flatness and bass energy

### Changed
- Music detector streaming analysis now uses adaptive frame skipping based on episode length
- Block length increased from 256 to 512 for more efficient streaming processing

---

## [0.1.189] - 2026-01-11

### Fixed
- **Duplicate episodes in RSS feeds**: Same episode appearing multiple times due to CDN updates (e.g., `?updated=` params) are now de-duplicated. Episodes are matched by normalized title + published date, keeping only the latest version - matching podcast app behavior.

### Changed
- **Ad editor UX improvement**: Replaced absolute MM:SS timestamp inputs with simpler relative adjustment controls. Users can now adjust ad boundaries with +/- buttons and see "Start: +X sec" / "End: -Y sec" which is more intuitive since the audio they hear is the processed version with ads removed.

### Added
- `cleanup_duplicate_episodes()` database function for removing existing duplicates

---

## [0.1.188] - 2026-01-09

### Fixed
- **RSS 503 errors after episode processing**: RSS cache was being deleted after processing, but when upstream returned 304 Not Modified there was no content to regenerate. Now regenerates RSS immediately after processing completes, and forces full fetch when cache is missing as a fallback.
- **Auto-process timeout incorrectly marked as failure**: When processing takes longer than 10 minutes (common for 1-2 hour episodes), the auto-process queue was marking the episode as "failed" with no error message, even though processing was still running. Now correctly detects ongoing processing and re-queues for later status check instead of failing.

---

## [0.1.187] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed
- **Transcripts/chapters now appear immediately in podcast apps**: RSS cache is now invalidated after episode processing completes, ensuring Podcasting 2.0 tags are included right away instead of waiting for next feed refresh
- **Reduced failures for newly published episodes**: Added CDN availability check (HEAD request) before downloading audio. When CDN returns 4xx/5xx, the error is classified as transient and will be retried instead of failing immediately
- **Improved back-to-back ad detection**: When an ad's end_text contains a different sponsor's URL (e.g., ad for "Better Wild" ending with "mintmobile.com"), the system now looks for the next detected ad. If that ad's sponsor matches the end_text URL, the current ad is extended to meet it, eliminating gaps between consecutive ads from different sponsors

---

## [0.1.186] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed
- **Podcasting 2.0 chapters not appearing in podcast apps**: Fixed incorrect MIME type for chapters. The spec requires `application/json+chapters` but we were using `application/json`. Updated both the RSS tag type attribute and HTTP Content-Type header.

---

## [0.1.185] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed
- **Episode descriptions missing for auto-processed episodes**: Episodes processed via the auto-process queue were not receiving descriptions from the RSS feed. The queue system now stores and passes descriptions through to processing. Episodes that were only auto-processed will need to be reprocessed to get their descriptions populated.

---

## [0.1.184] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed
- **Ad validation false positive bug**: Fixed `NOT_AD_PATTERNS` regex that incorrectly rejected high-confidence ads (99%) when Claude's reason contained phrases like "unrelated to episode content". The regex now uses negative lookbehinds to exclude "unrelated to", "different from", and "not " prefixes which actually indicate something IS an ad.

---

## [0.1.183] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed
- **AI topic detection prompt**: Made Claude output format explicit with "OUTPUT FORMAT: Return ONLY topic lines, one per line. No introduction, no explanation, no numbering." and added examples. This prevents Claude from adding preamble like "Here are the 6 major topic changes:" that caused parsing to fail.

---

## [0.1.181] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed
- **VTT chapter regeneration**: Fixed critical bug where regenerating chapters from VTT caused double timestamp adjustment. VTT segments are already adjusted for removed ads, so the regenerate endpoint now uses a new `generate_chapters_from_vtt` method that works directly with VTT timestamps and uses AI topic detection without ad-based adjustment.

### Changed
- **UI improvement**: Moved "Regenerate Chapters" into the Reprocess dropdown menu for cleaner UI

---

## [0.1.179] - 2026-01-03

### Added
- **Regenerate chapters endpoint**: New API endpoint `POST /feeds/<slug>/episodes/<episode_id>/regenerate-chapters` to regenerate chapters without full reprocessing. Uses existing VTT transcript and ad markers.
- **UI button for regenerate chapters**: Added "Regenerate Chapters" button to episode detail page for episodes with VTT transcripts

---

## [0.1.178] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed
- **Chapter generation debugging**: Added detailed logging to see Claude's response when detecting topic boundaries. This will help diagnose why AI split is returning 0 topics.
- Improved regex pattern to handle various timestamp formats (MM:SS, MM:SS:, MM:SS -)

---

## [0.1.177] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed
- **Chapter generation bugfix**: Fixed `_reverse_adjust_timestamp` to correctly map adjusted times back to original transcript times when first ad starts at 0. This was preventing AI topic splitting from finding the correct transcript segment.
- Added debug logging to `split_long_segments` for troubleshooting

---

## [0.1.176] - 2026-01-03

### Added
- **Improved chapter generation**:
  - Fixed HTML description parsing for timestamp extraction (handles `<br>` tags properly)
  - Content-aware chapter detection: Long segments (>15 min) are automatically split using AI topic detection
  - Topic-based chapter detection: Descriptions with topic headers but no timestamps (like Windows Weekly show notes) are matched to transcript positions using AI

---

## [0.1.175] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed
- **Force refresh option for feeds**: Added `force` parameter to feed refresh API endpoints (`POST /api/v1/feeds/<slug>/refresh` and `POST /api/v1/feeds/refresh`) to bypass conditional GET (304 Not Modified) and regenerate RSS even when source feed hasn't changed. This is needed after code updates that change RSS format.

---

## [0.1.174] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed
- **End-of-episode ad handling**: When the last ad has less than 30 seconds of content remaining after it, the episode now ends with a beep instead of including the trailing content (which is often post-roll ad residue)

---

## [0.1.173] - 2026-01-03

### Added
- **Podcasting 2.0 Transcript and Chapters Support**
  - VTT transcripts with timestamps adjusted for removed ads
  - JSON chapters generated from ad boundaries and episode description timestamps
  - AI-generated chapter titles using Claude Haiku
  - New RSS namespace: `xmlns:podcast="https://podcastindex.org/namespace/1.0"`

  - `GET /episodes/<slug>/<episode_id>.vtt` - VTT transcript
  - `GET /episodes/<slug>/<episode_id>/chapters.json` - Chapters JSON
- Settings UI toggles for VTT transcripts and chapters generation
- Episode detail shows VTT and Chapters badges when available
- Download links for VTT and chapters in episode detail page

### Fixed
- **Chapters startTime compatibility with podcast apps**
  - Changed from float values (738.8) to integers (739)
  - Changed minimum startTime from 0 to 1 (required by some apps like Pocket Casts)
  - Based on analysis of working No Agenda podcast feed format

### Changed
- VTT and chapters stored in database instead of filesystem
- RSS transcript tag now includes `rel="captions"` attribute
- Chapters MIME type changed to `application/json` (from non-standard type)

---

## [0.1.172] - 2026-01-01

### Added
- **Early Ad Snapping to 0:00**
  - Ads that start within 30 seconds of episode start are snapped to 0:00
  - Pre-roll ads often have brief intro audio before detection kicks in
  - New constant `EARLY_AD_SNAP_THRESHOLD = 30.0` in ad_detector.py
  - Logged when snapping occurs: "Snapped early ad to 0:00: X.Xs -> 0.0s"

- **Queue Position Tracking**
  - New `get_queue_position()` method in StatusService
  - Returns 1-based queue position for episodes waiting to be processed
  - Enables users to know when their episode will be processed

### Changed
- **Queue Busy Response**
  - Changed from HTTP 302 redirect to HTTP 503 Service Unavailable
  - Previously: Redirected to original (unprocessed) audio URL when queue busy
  - Now: Returns 503 with JSON body containing queue position and Retry-After header
  - Podcast players will now retry instead of caching the unprocessed file
  - Response includes: status, message, queuePosition, retryAfter (60 seconds)

---

  - Saves scroll position when opening editor, restores on close

---

## [0.1.168] - 2025-12-23

### Added
- **Pattern Creation from Boundary Adjustments**
  - Saving an adjustment now creates a pattern (like confirm does)
  - Uses the ADJUSTED boundaries to extract transcript text
  - Enables cross-episode pattern learning from corrected ad boundaries
  - If pattern already exists, increments confirmation count
  - Stores adjusted text in correction for future matching

---

## [0.1.167] - 2025-12-23

### Added
- **Cross-Episode False Positive Matching**
  - When marking a segment as "not an ad", the transcript text is now stored
  - Future detections across all episodes of the same podcast are compared against rejected segments
  - Uses TF-IDF similarity matching (threshold: 0.75) to skip similar content
  - Prevents the same show intro/outro from being repeatedly flagged as ads
  - New API endpoint: `POST /api/v1/patterns/backfill-false-positives` to populate text for existing corrections
  - New database method: `get_podcast_false_positive_texts()` for cross-episode lookup
  - Logs when detections are skipped due to cross-episode false positive match

---

## [0.1.166] - 2025-12-23

### Added
- **Independent Prompt Reset**
  - New "Reset Prompts Only" button in Settings page

  - Added logging to confirm/reject correction handlers for debugging

---

## [0.1.165] - 2025-12-23

### Added
- **Per-Podcast Second Pass Toggle**
  - New `skipSecondPass` setting for podcasts that discuss products (tech shows, etc.)
  - Second pass detection was too aggressive for shows like Windows Weekly
  - Prevents false positives where product discussions are flagged as "subtle ads"
  - Toggle via API: `PATCH /api/v1/feeds/{slug}` with `{"skipSecondPass": true}`
  - Setting is logged during processing: "Second pass skipped (podcast setting)"

### Fixed
- **Ad Merge Bug for Overlapping Segments**
  - Fixed bug where overlapping/contained ads would shrink instead of extend
  - Example: Ad A (100-300s) + Ad B (150-200s) now correctly merges to 100-300s
  - Previously would incorrectly shrink to 100-200s, causing audio artifacts

---

---

## [0.1.88] - 2025-12-11

### Fixed
- ONNX Runtime cuDNN compatibility crash: `Could not load library libcudnn_ops_infer.so.8`
  - Root cause: CUDA 12.4 includes cuDNN 9.x, but ONNX Runtime (used by pyannote.audio) requires cuDNN 8.x
  - Workers crashed with code 134 (SIGABRT) when attempting speaker diarization
  - Rolled back to CUDA 12.1 with cuDNN 8 for full compatibility

### Changed
- Downgraded to CUDA 12.1 base image (nvidia/cuda:12.1.1-cudnn8-runtime-ubuntu22.04)
- Using PyTorch 2.3.0+cu121 and torchaudio 2.3.0+cu121
- Pinned pyannote.audio to >=3.1.0,<4.0.0 (v4.0 requires torch>=2.8.0 which needs CUDA 12.4)

---

---

## [0.1.86] - 2025-12-11

### Fixed
- App startup failure: `PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/app/src/audio_analysis/__init__.py'`
  - Root cause: `chmod -R 644 ./src/*.py` glob pattern only matched files in `./src/`, not subdirectories
  - Fixed by using `find ./src -type f -name '*.py' -exec chmod 644 {} \;` to recursively set permissions

### Changed
- Docker image optimizations to reduce size (~12GB -> ~8-9GB estimated)
  - Pre-install PyTorch with specific CUDA 12.1 build to prevent duplicate installations

---

## [0.1.76] - 2025-12-03

### Fixed
- Same-sponsor ad merge extracting "read" as a sponsor name
  - `extract_sponsor_names()` was matching "sponsor read" and extracting "read" as a brand
  - Added exclusion list: read, segment, content, break, complete, partial, full, spot, mention, plug, insert, message, promo, promotion
  - Prevents false sponsor matches that caused unrelated ads to merge
- Same-sponsor merge creating over-long ads that get rejected by validator
  - Added 300s (5 min) maximum duration check before merging
  - If merge would exceed limit, ads are kept separate instead
  - Root cause: Two legitimate ads (~155s + ~75s) were incorrectly merged into 351s ad, which AdValidator rejected as too long

---

## [0.1.75] - 2025-12-02

### Added

---

## [0.1.72] - 2025-12-03

### Fixed
- Wrap descriptions in CDATA to fix invalid XML in RSS feeds
  - Channel descriptions were not escaped, causing raw HTML and `&nbsp;` entities to break XML parsing

  - Models are fetched dynamically from Anthropic API, so validation was unnecessary
  - Any model available in the dropdown is now accepted
- Updated OpenAPI documentation with secondPassModel field (was missing in 0.1.66)

---

## [0.1.66] - 2025-12-02

### Added
- Independent second pass model selection
  - New setting `secondPassModel` allows using a different Claude model for second pass
  - Visible in Settings UI when Multi-Pass Detection is enabled
  - Defaults to Claude Sonnet 4.5 for cost optimization
  - API: PUT /settings/ad-detection accepts `secondPassModel` field
- Sliding window approach for ad detection
  - Transcripts are now processed in 10-minute overlapping windows
  - 3-minute overlap between windows to catch ads at chunk boundaries
  - Applies to both first and second pass detection
  - Detections across windows are automatically merged and deduplicated
  - Improves accuracy for long episodes

### Technical
- New database setting: `second_pass_model`
- New helper functions: `create_windows()`, `deduplicate_window_ads()`
- New method: `get_second_pass_model()` in AdDetector class
- Constants: `WINDOW_SIZE_SECONDS=600`, `WINDOW_OVERLAP_SECONDS=180`
- Refactored JSON parsing into reusable `_parse_ads_from_response()` method

---

## [0.1.65] - 2025-12-01

### Added
- Second pass prompt is now configurable via Settings UI and API
  - New textarea in Settings page (shown when Multi-Pass Detection is enabled)
  - API endpoint PUT /settings/ad-detection accepts secondPassPrompt field
  - Stored in database like other settings, with reset-to-defaults support

### Changed
- Renamed "System Prompt" to "First Pass System Prompt" in Settings UI for clarity
- Updated OpenAPI documentation with secondPassPrompt fields

---

## [0.1.64] - 2025-12-01

### Changed
- Moved episode description below playback bar in episode detail view
  - Audio player now appears immediately after title/metadata
  - Description follows below for better UX (play first, read second)

---

## [0.1.63] - 2025-12-01

### Fixed
- Same-sponsor merge now works for short gaps without requiring sponsor mention in gap
  - If gap < 120 seconds AND both ads mention same sponsor: merge unconditionally
  - This fixes cases where transition content between ad parts doesn't mention sponsor
  - Example: Vention ad with 46s gap of "Mike Elgin" intro content now merges correctly

### Changed
- Sponsor extraction now also parses ad reason field
  - Extracts brand name from "Vention sponsor read" -> "vention"
  - Helps identify same-sponsor ads even when transcript doesn't have clear URL

---

## [0.1.62] - 2025-12-01

### Added
- Same-sponsor ad merging to fix fragmented ad detection
  - Extracts sponsor names from transcript (URLs, domain mentions)
  - If two ads mention same sponsor AND gap between them also mentions that sponsor, merge them
  - Fixes cases where Claude fragments long ads into pieces or mislabels parts
  - Example: Vention ad split into 3 parts with "Zapier" mislabel now merges correctly

### Technical
- New `extract_sponsor_names()` function - finds sponsors via URL/domain patterns
- New `get_transcript_text_for_range()` - gets transcript text for time ranges
- New `merge_same_sponsor_ads()` - merges ads with same sponsor in gap content
- Max gap of 5 minutes for sponsor-based merging
- Runs after boundary refinement, before audio processing

---

## [0.1.61] - 2025-12-01

### Added
- Intelligent ad boundary detection using word timestamps and keyword scanning
  - Whisper now returns word-level timestamps (without splitting segments)
  - Post-processing scans for transition phrases near detected ad boundaries
  - Transition phrases like "let's take a break", "word from our sponsor" adjust START time
  - Return phrases like "anyway", "back to the show" adjust END time
  - Falls back to segment-level boundaries if no keywords found
  - Adapts to each podcast's style instead of using hardcoded buffers

### Technical
- New `refine_ad_boundaries()` function in ad_detector.py
- AD_START_PHRASES and AD_END_PHRASES constants for keyword detection
- Word timestamps stored with segments but segments not split (avoids v0.1.59 issues)
- Refinement runs after merge_and_deduplicate(), before audio processing

---

## [0.1.60] - 2025-12-01

### Fixed
- Episode descriptions now have ALL blank lines removed (single-spaced)
  - Previous regex collapsed to paragraph breaks; now removes all blank lines
- Reverted segment splitting from v0.1.59 - it made ad detection WORSE
  - v0.1.59: Splitting disconnected transition phrases from sponsor content
  - Vention ad went from wrong END (26:04-26:34) to wrong START (27:51-28:19)
  - Original 45s segments were fine for finding ad START; problem was finding END
- Rate limit handling improved for 429 errors
  - Now waits 60 seconds for rate limit window to reset before retry
  - Both first and second pass have this handling

### Changed
- Ad extension heuristic improved
  - Threshold increased from 60s to 90s (detect more potentially incomplete ads)
  - Extension increased from 30s to 45s (catch more of the actual ad content)
- Streamlined system prompt (~70% size reduction)
  - Removed redundant "find all ads" messaging (repeated 5+ times)
  - Removed second example
  - Consolidated AD END guidance sections
  - Removed REMINDER sections that repeated earlier content
  - Kept brand lists (helpful for detection)
  - Result: ~3KB prompt instead of ~11KB, fewer tokens consumed

---

## [0.1.59] - 2025-12-01

### Fixed
- Improved whitespace collapsing in episode description display
  - Better regex that handles consecutive whitespace-only lines
  - Previous regex only handled pairs, not runs of blank lines

### Changed
- Dramatically improved ad detection precision with finer transcript granularity
  - **Root cause**: Whisper VAD was creating 45+ second segments, making precise ad boundaries impossible
  - Enabled word-level timestamps in Whisper transcription
  - Added segment splitting: long segments (>15s) are now split on word boundaries
  - Result: ~3x more segments but much more precise ad start/end detection
- Added automatic extension for short ads that end on URLs
  - If ad is under 60s and end_text contains a URL, extend by 30s
  - Safety net for cases where Claude still ends too early at first URL mention

---

## [0.1.58] - 2025-12-01

### Fixed
- Improved newline collapsing in episode description display
  - Now handles lines containing only whitespace (spaces/tabs)
  - Previous regex only matched truly empty lines

### Added
- end_text logging for ad detection debugging
  - Logs the last 50 chars of end_text for each detected ad segment
  - Helps understand why Claude thinks an ad ended where it did

### Changed
- Enhanced AD END SIGNALS guidance in both prompts
  - Added explicit "FINDING THE TRUE AD END" section
  - Clarifies that ad ends when SHOW CONTENT resumes, not when pitch ends
  - Lists signals to look for AFTER the pitch (topic change, "anyway", etc.)
  - Lists what NOT to end on (first URL, product description, pauses)

---

## [0.1.57] - 2025-12-01

### Fixed
- Removed seed parameter from API calls (not supported by Anthropic SDK)
- Collapsed excessive newlines in UI description display (3+ newlines -> 2)

---

## [0.1.56] - 2025-12-01

### Added
- Description logging: logs when episode description is/isn't included in prompts
- Prompt hash logging: logs MD5 hash of prompt for debugging non-determinism

### Changed
- Prompts now indicate ads are ALWAYS expected (empty result almost never correct)
- Description context clarified in prompts (describes content topics, may list sponsors)
- UI description display preserves formatting (line breaks, list items)

---

## [0.1.55] - 2025-12-01

### Fixed
- Improved ad segment end time detection in second pass prompt
  - Added explicit instructions for finding COMPLETE ad segments
  - Ads under 45 seconds now trigger verification prompt for true end time
  - Added AD END SIGNALS guidance (transitions, topic returns, stingers)
  - Root cause: DEEL ad detected as 29s when actual duration was 92s

### Added
- Episode descriptions now available in UI and API
  - Descriptions extracted from RSS feed and stored in database
  - Displayed below episode title in list and detail views
  - Passed to Claude for ad detection (helps identify sponsors, chapters)
  - HTML tags stripped for clean display
- Short ad duration warning in logs
  - Warns when detected ads are under 30 seconds (typical ads are 60-120s)
  - Helps identify potentially incomplete ad segment detection

### Changed
- Enhanced `BLIND_SECOND_PASS_SYSTEM_PROMPT` with boundary detection guidance
- `USER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE` now includes optional episode description field
- Database schema: added `description` column to episodes table

---

## [0.1.54] - 2025-12-01

### Fixed
- Fixed `adsRemovedFirstPass` and `adsRemovedSecondPass` count calculation
  - Previous: calculated as `total - firstPassCount` which gave negative/incorrect values after merging
  - New: counts based on actual `pass` field in merged results
  - `first_pass_count = first_only + merged` (ads found by first pass)
  - `second_pass_count = second_only + merged` (ads found by second pass)
- Improved logging to show breakdown: `first:X, second:Y, merged:Z`

---

## [0.1.53] - 2025-12-01

### Changed
- Second pass now runs BLIND (no knowledge of first pass results)
  - Previous approach: tell second pass what first pass found, ask to find more
  - New approach: second pass analyzes independently with different detection focus
  - Second pass specializes in subtle/baked-in ads that don't sound like traditional ads
  - Results merged automatically using improved algorithm
- Improved merge algorithm for combining pass results
  - Overlapping segments merged: takes earliest start, latest end
  - Adjacent segments (within 2s gap) also merged
  - Non-overlapping segments kept as separate ads
  - Ads now marked as `pass: 1`, `pass: 2`, or `pass: 'merged'`
- UI shows "Merged" badge (green) for segments detected by both passes

### Technical
- `BLIND_SECOND_PASS_SYSTEM_PROMPT` replaces previous informed prompt
- `detect_ads_second_pass()` no longer takes `first_pass_ads` parameter
- `merge_and_deduplicate()` rewritten with interval merging algorithm
- Frontend types: `AdSegment.pass` now `1 | 2 | 'merged'`

---

## [0.1.52] - 2025-12-01

### Changed
- Made second pass ad detection more aggressive
  - Reframes first pass reviewer as "junior/inexperienced" to encourage skepticism
  - Added "DETECTION BIAS: When in doubt, mark it as an ad"
  - Added explicit instruction to NOT just confirm first pass work
  - Removed verification step - focus only on finding missed ads
  - Should increase likelihood of catching non-obvious advertisements

---

## [0.1.51] - 2025-11-30

### Changed
- Multi-pass ad detection now uses parallel analysis instead of sequential re-transcription
  - Both passes analyze the SAME original transcript (not re-transcribed after processing)
  - Second pass now runs with different prompt to find ads first pass might have missed
  - Results merged with deduplication (>50% overlap = same ad)
  - Audio processed ONCE with all detected ads (faster, more efficient)
- Second pass prompt redesigned as "skeptical reviewer" approach
  - Given first pass results as context
  - Looks for: short ads, ads without sponsor language, baked-in ads, post-roll ads
  - Returns only NEW ads not already found by first pass

### Added
- Per-pass ad tracking in database and UI
  - New columns: `ads_removed_firstpass`, `ads_removed_secondpass`
  - API returns `adsRemovedFirstPass` and `adsRemovedSecondPass` fields
  - Each ad marker now has `pass` field (1 or 2) indicating which pass found it
- Pass badges in Episode Detail UI
  - Ads marked with "Pass 1" (blue) or "Pass 2" (purple) badges
  - Header shows breakdown: "Detected Ads (11) (5 first pass, 6 second pass)"
- `merge_and_deduplicate()` function for combining pass results

### Technical
- Database migration adds `ads_removed_firstpass`, `ads_removed_secondpass` columns
- Frontend types updated: `AdSegment.pass?: 1 | 2`, `EpisodeDetail.adsRemovedFirstPass/SecondPass`

---

## [0.1.50] - 2025-11-30

### Added
- UI toggle for multi-pass ad detection in Settings page
  - New styled toggle switch to enable/disable multi-pass detection
  - Settings now properly persisted and displayed

### Changed
- Database schema: renamed `claude_prompt`/`claude_raw_response` columns to `first_pass_prompt`/`first_pass_response`
- Added new columns: `second_pass_prompt`, `second_pass_response` to store multi-pass detection data
- API response field changes (breaking change for API consumers):
  - `claudePrompt` renamed to `firstPassPrompt`
  - `claudeRawResponse` renamed to `firstPassResponse`
  - Added `secondPassPrompt`, `secondPassResponse` fields
- Second pass detection now returns and stores prompt/response for debugging

---

## [0.1.49] - 2025-11-30

### Added
- API reliability with retry logic for transient Claude API errors
  - Retries up to 3 times on 529 overloaded, 500, 502, 503, rate limit errors
  - Exponential backoff with jitter (2s base, 60s max)
  - Episodes now track `adDetectionStatus` (success/failed) in database and API
  - New endpoint: `POST /feeds/<slug>/episodes/<episode_id>/retry-ad-detection`
    - Retries ad detection using existing transcript (no re-transcription needed)
- Multi-pass ad detection (opt-in feature)
  - Enable via Settings API: `PUT /settings/ad-detection` with `{"multiPassEnabled": true}`
  - When enabled, after first-pass processing:
    1. Re-transcribes the processed audio (where first-pass ads are now beeps)
    2. Runs second-pass detection looking for missed ads
    3. First-pass ads provided as context ("we found these, look for similar")
    4. Processes audio again if additional ads found
  - Combined ad count and time saved from both passes
  - Note: Approximately doubles transcription and API costs when enabled

### Changed
- Expanded DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT for better ad detection accuracy
  - Added DETECTION BIAS guidance: "When in doubt, mark it as an ad"
  - Added RETAIL/CONSUMER BRANDS list (Nordstrom, Macy's, Target, Nike, Sephora, etc.)
  - Added RETAIL/COMMERCIAL AD INDICATORS section (shopping CTAs, free shipping, price mentions)
  - Added NETWORK/RADIO-STYLE ADS section for ads without podcast-specific elements
  - Added second example showing Nordstrom-style retail ad detection
  - Strengthened REMINDER section to catch all ad types
  - Note: Users with custom prompts should reset to default in Settings to get improvements

### Fixed
- Joe Rogan episode type issue: Claude API 529 overloaded error was silently returning 0 ads
  - Now properly retries and blocks until success or permanent failure
  - Failed detection clearly marked in UI/API (adDetectionStatus: "failed")

---

## [0.1.48] - 2025-11-29

### Added
- Enhanced request logging with detailed info
  - All routes now log: IP address, user-agent, response time (ms), status code
  - Format: `GET /path 200 45ms [192.168.1.100] [Podcast App/1.0]`
  - Applied to RSS feeds (`/<slug>`), episodes (`/episodes/*`), health check, and all API routes
  - Static files (`/ui/*`, `/docs`) excluded to reduce noise

---

## [0.1.47] - 2025-11-29

### Changed
- Replaced load_data_json/save_data_json patterns with direct database calls in main.py
  - Eliminates race conditions during concurrent episode processing
  - More efficient single-episode updates (no longer loads/saves all episodes)
  - Affected: refresh_rss_feed, process_episode (start/complete/fail), serve_episode

### Added
- File size display in episode detail UI
  - Shows processed file size in MB next to duration
  - Added fileSize to API response and TypeScript types

---

## [0.1.46] - 2025-11-29

### Fixed
- "Detected Ads" section not showing in episode detail UI
  - Frontend still referenced `ad_segments` after API cleanup removed it in v0.1.45
  - Updated EpisodeDetail.tsx to use `adMarkers` field

---

## [0.1.45] - 2025-11-29

### Changed
- Improved ad detection system prompt for better boundary precision
  - Added AD START SIGNALS section to capture transitions ("let's take a break", etc.)
  - Added POST-ROLL ADS section to detect local business ads at end of episodes
  - Updated example to show transition phrase included in ad segment
- Longer fade-in after beep (0.8s instead of 0.5s) for smoother return to content
  - Content fade-out before beep: 0.5s (unchanged)
  - Content fade-in after beep: 0.8s (was 0.5s)
  - Beep fades: 0.5s (unchanged)
- "Run Cleanup" button renamed to "Delete All Episodes"
  - Now immediately deletes ALL processed episodes (ignores retention period)
  - Uses double-click confirmation pattern (click once to arm, click again to confirm)
  - Button turns red when armed, auto-resets after 3 seconds

### Fixed
- Removed duplicate snake_case fields from episode API response
  - Removed: original_url, processed_url, ad_segments, ad_count
  - Kept camelCase equivalents: originalUrl, processedUrl, adMarkers, adsRemoved

---

## [0.1.44] - 2025-11-29

### Fixed
- Beep replacement only playing for first ad when multiple ads detected
  - Root cause: ffmpeg input streams can only be used once in filter_complex
  - Added asplit to create N copies of beep input for N ads
  - Now all ads get proper beep replacement with fades
- RETENTION_PERIOD env var being ignored after initial database setup
  - Env var now takes precedence over database setting
  - Allows runtime override without database modification

---

## [0.1.43] - 2025-11-29

### Added
- Audio fading on replacement beep (0.5s fade-in and fade-out)
  - Creates smoother transitions: content fade-out -> beep fade-in -> beep fade-out -> content fade-in
- end_text field back in ad detection prompt for debugging ad boundary issues
  - Shows last 3-5 words Claude identified as the ad ending
  - Stored in API response for debugging, not used programmatically

### Changed
- Claude API temperature set to 0.0 (was 0.2)
  - Makes ad detection deterministic - same transcript produces same results
  - Fixes ad count varying between reprocesses of the same episode

---

## [0.1.42] - 2025-11-29

### Fixed
- Audio fading still not working after v0.1.41 fix
  - Root cause: ffmpeg atrim filter does not reset timestamps
  - Added asetpts=PTS-STARTPTS after atrim to reset timestamps to 0-based
  - Without this, afade st= parameter was looking for timestamps that did not exist in the trimmed stream

---

## [0.1.41] - 2025-11-29

### Fixed
- Audio fading not working due to incorrect ffmpeg afade timing
  - afade st= parameter was using absolute time instead of trimmed segment time
  - Now correctly calculates fade start relative to segment duration

---

## [0.1.40] - 2025-11-29

### Fixed
- Ad detection regression from v0.1.38 (5 ads -> 3 ads)
  - Removed complex MID-BLOCK BOUNDARY example that overwhelmed Claude
  - Removed end_text field requirement from output format
  - Simplified prompt restores ad detection accuracy

### Added
- Audio fading at ad boundaries (0.5s fade-in/fade-out)

  - Note: Users with custom prompts should reset to default in Settings

---

## [0.1.39] - 2025-11-29

### Fixed
- Ad detector not parsing "end_text" field from Claude response
  - Prompt requested end_text but ad_detector.py was not extracting it from response
  - Now correctly parses and includes end_text in ad segment data
  - Enables debugging of ad boundary precision issues

---

## [0.1.38] - 2025-11-29

### Changed
- Improved ad boundary precision in DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT
  - Added required "end_text" field to output format (last 3-5 words of ad)
  - Added concrete MID-BLOCK BOUNDARY example with calculation walkthrough
  - Helps Claude identify exact ad ending points within timestamp blocks
  - Note: Users with custom prompts should reset to default in Settings

---

  - Note: Users with custom prompts should reset to default in Settings to get improvements

---

## [0.1.36] - 2025-11-29

### Fixed
- Ad detection returning 0 ads for host-read sponsor segments
  - Claude was distinguishing between "traditional ads" and "sponsor reads" and excluding the latter
  - Updated DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT with explicit instructions that host-read sponsor segments ARE ads
  - Added CRITICAL section and REMINDER to prevent Claude from excluding naturally-integrated sponsor content
  - Note: Users with custom system prompts should reset to default in Settings to get the fix

---

## [0.1.35] - 2025-11-29

### Changed
- Completed filesystem cleanup for transcript and ads data
  - Removed legacy filesystem fallback in `get_transcript()` - now reads only from database
  - Removed `delete_transcript()` and `delete_ads_json()` methods (database handles all data)
  - Simplified `cleanup_episode_files()` to only delete `.mp3` files
  - Removed filesystem migration code from database initialization
  - Reprocess endpoint now only clears database (no filesystem delete calls)
- Filesystem now stores only: artwork, processed mp3, feed.xml

---

## [0.1.34] - 2025-11-28

### Changed

  - `save_transcript()` and `save_ads_json()` were still writing `-transcript.txt` and `-ads.json` files
  - Now stores transcript and ad data exclusively in database (no more duplicate files)
  - Removed dead `save_prompt()` function (unused since v0.1.32)

---

## [0.1.32] - 2025-11-28

### Fixed
- `claudePrompt` field always null in episode API response
  - `save_ads_json()` in storage.py was not extracting `prompt` from ad_detector result
  - Now correctly saves prompt to database alongside raw_response and ad_markers
  - Note: Existing episodes will still have null prompt; only newly processed episodes will have it

---

## [0.1.31] - 2025-11-28

### Fixed
- `claudePrompt` and `claudeRawResponse` fields missing from episode detail API response
  - Fields were documented in v0.1.26 CHANGELOG but never added to the API response
  - Data was stored correctly in database, just not returned to clients

---

## [0.1.30] - 2025-11-28

### Fixed
- Settings page 500 error (ImportError for removed DEFAULT_USER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE)
  - Missed removing import statement in api.py when removing constant from database.py

---

## [0.1.29] - 2025-11-28

### Removed
- `userPromptTemplate` from Settings UI/API
  - This setting was not useful to customize (just formats the transcript)
  - Template is now hardcoded in ad_detector.py
  - Reduces API surface area and simplifies settings

---

## [0.1.28] - 2025-11-28

### Fixed
- `claudePrompt` field always null in episode API response

  - Previously written to both database AND filesystem (wasted disk space)
  - Files removed: `-transcript.txt`, `-ads.json`, `-prompt.txt`
- Simplified episode cleanup - only deletes `.mp3` files (database cascade handles metadata)
- `/transcript` endpoint now reads from database instead of filesystem

### Added
- `claudePrompt` and `claudeRawResponse` fields in episode detail API response
  - Useful for debugging ad detection issues

### Removed
- Unused storage methods: `save_transcript`, `get_transcript`, `save_ads_json`, `save_prompt`, `delete_transcript`, `delete_ads_json`, `cleanup_episode_files`

---

## [0.1.25] - 2025-11-28

### Fixed

---

## [0.1.17] - 2025-11-27

### Fixed
- Audio download failing with 403 Forbidden on certain podcast CDNs (e.g., Acast)
  - Added browser-like User-Agent headers to audio and artwork download requests

---

## [0.1.16] - 2025-11-27

### Fixed
- Container fails to start with "Permission denied: /app/entrypoint.sh"
  - Changed entrypoint.sh permissions from 711 to 755 (readable by all users)
- RETENTION_PERIOD documentation was misleading (said "days" but code uses minutes)
  - Updated README, docker-compose, and Dockerfile to clarify it's in minutes
  - Changed default from 30 to 1440 (24 hours) to match original intent

---

## [0.1.15] - 2025-11-27

### Fixed
- Favicon not loading - file had restrictive permissions (600) preventing non-root access

---

## [0.1.14] - 2025-11-27

### Fixed
- Permission denied error when running as any non-root user
  - HuggingFace cache now writes to `/app/data/.cache` (inside the mounted volume)
  - Added entrypoint.sh to create required directories at runtime
  - Model downloads on first run to the mounted volume (owned by running user)
  - Works with any `user:` setting in docker-compose, not just 1000:1000

### Changed
- Removed pre-downloaded model from image (was being hidden by volume mount anyway)
- Switched from CMD to ENTRYPOINT for better container initialization

---

## [0.1.13] - 2025-11-27

  - Set proper permissions (777) on data and cache directories

---

## [0.1.12] - 2025-11-27

### Fixed
- Claude JSON parsing - improved extraction with multiple fallback strategies:
  - First tries markdown code blocks
  - Then finds all valid JSON arrays and uses the last one with ad structure
  - Falls back to first-to-last bracket extraction
- System prompt simplified to explicitly request JSON-only output (no analysis text)

### Added
- Search icon in header linking to Podcast Index for finding podcast RSS feeds

---

## [0.1.11] - 2025-11-27

### Fixed

- JSON parsing for Claude responses - now strips markdown code blocks before parsing
- MIME type error behind reverse proxy - return 404 for missing assets instead of index.html
- Asset fallback for Docker - if volume-mounted assets folder is empty, falls back to builtin assets

### Changed
- GPU logging now shows device count instead of GPU name/memory (torch no longer required)
- Dockerfile copies assets to both `/app/assets/` and `/app/assets_builtin/` for fallback support

---

## [0.1.10] - 2025-11-27

### Added
- Mobile navigation hamburger menu - Settings now accessible on mobile devices
- Podcast Index link on Dashboard - helps users find podcast RSS feeds at podcastindex.org
- Version logging on startup - logs app version when server starts
- GPU discovery logging - logs CUDA GPU name and memory when available

### Fixed
- Suppressed noisy ONNX Runtime GPU discovery warnings in logs
- Better Claude JSON parsing error logging - logs raw response for debugging

---

## [0.1.9] - 2025-11-27

### Fixed
- Podcast files now saved in correct location: `/app/data/podcasts/{slug}/` instead of `/app/data/{slug}/`

- Auto-clear invalid Claude model IDs from database instead of just warning
- Fixed invalid model ID examples in openapi.yaml

---

## [0.1.7] - 2025-11-27

### Changed
- Version bump for Portainer cache refresh

---

## [0.1.5] - 2025-11-27

### Fixed

### Changed
- Slug generation now fetches RSS feed to get podcast name (e.g., "tosh-show" instead of "rss")
- Added Claude Opus 4.5 to available models list
- Model validation now checks against VALID_MODELS list

---

## [0.1.3] - 2025-11-27

### Fixed

- Empty assets folder in Docker image - assets/replace.mp3 now properly included

### Changed
- Default model changed from invalid claude-opus-4-5-20250929 to claude-sonnet-4-5-20250514
- Updated fallback model list with correct model IDs:
  - claude-sonnet-4-5-20250514 (Claude Sonnet 4.5)
  - claude-sonnet-4-20250514 (Claude Sonnet 4)
  - claude-opus-4-1-20250414 (Claude Opus 4.1)
  - claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)

### Note
- Users must re-select model from Settings UI after update to save a valid model ID to database

---

## [0.1.2] - 2025-11-26

### Fixed
